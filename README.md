## Research Questions
* How has COVID-19 affected women's health and wellness habits?

## Sample
Text data was web-scraped from Refinery29's online publication series the [Feel Good Diaries](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/feel-good-diaries?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=adsales&utm_campaign=ES_VenusVeraBradley/Venus&fbclid=IwAR0dbdfif3nApRxN4nrqJI-e7I0wfNaGJliSVc5-hg7n-hjatc3_hrxyo_M), which chronicles women's health and wellness spending habits. There are 38 articles, all published between January 2019 to May 2020. Among these 38, only the most recent 7 articles were published during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project will be routinely updated to include new articles as more data. 

## Methods

* k-Fold Cross Validation
* Time series analysis

## Results
Top 5 Topics Discussed in the Feel Good Diaries:
