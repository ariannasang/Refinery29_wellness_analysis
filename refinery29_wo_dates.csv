Have your own Feel Good Diary about how you're coping around the COVID-19 outbreak? We'd love to hear how you're prioritizing your mental and physical health at this time. Submit your entry here!Today: A queer woman who is starting a flossing habit, thinks most workout videos are products of the patriarchy, and isn’t above Netflix and chill.Age: 24Location: Massachusetts  Occupation: Communications Specialist Salary: $70,000Day One: 11 a.m. — It’s Sunday, so I get to sleep in. Thank God — I was up late last night chatting and drinking wine with friends on Google Hangouts. But today’s a new day. I decide to re-download MyFitnessPal (free). I’ve used this app before to track what I’m eating and the exercises I’m doing, but I found it was enabling body-image issues. I might skip a meal to keep my calorie points lower, and so on. I want to give it a second try, though, because I think quarantine has altered my meal habits and I want to see if I’m right. Then, I pull up a PopSugar fitness video, which is free on their site. It’s customary for me to throw a huge fit before I start any exercise. Sometimes it feels that I’m only working out because of societal pressure. I know a lot of women find joy in exercising, but for me it’s hard to shake off the feeling that I’m sculpting my body to fit into a beauty standard set by straight men. Whether I’m right or wrong, I do know I feel less stiff after moving — so after a short rant about this to my partner, I press play. I follow along as an instructor with a bouncing ponytail leads me through an ab- and booty-burning workout, with moves including classic lunges and bicycle crunches. Aftewards I’m sore and feel conflicted, thanks to my inner feminist spirit. Noon — My lunch consists of a Daily Harvest smoothie. I have a subscription with them and get a box filled with 24 of their superfood goodies every month for $160. My blender is broken, so I end up eating chunky frozen fruit with a spoon. I spend the rest of the afternoon rereading essays from Calypso by David Sedaris. I received the book for my birthday many years ago. I watch as a thunderstorm rolls in. Although isolating due to the coronavirus has been tough, it’s been nice taking the time to enjoy nature. I’m usually mad about oncoming storms because I walk everywhere. Now, I’m feeling something akin to gratitude about a weather pattern I normally detest. Maybe this time in quarantine is forcing me to connect to my spiritual side. Maybe. 7 p.m. — I order in Chipotle ($15). You have to support your local restaurants, am I right? Then I video-chat with bae’s grandma, who is 93. She says we “look good.” I take that compliment to heart and decide I’m no longer using this nutrition app. Thank God. I delete it. I decide to skip TV tonight to work on my digital work portfolio. I’m trying to take a break from all of the binge watching. The first few weeks of quarantine, I burned through three seasons of Gilmore Girls and I want to challenge myself to find other ways to use my time. Plus, although my job is safe right now, it makes me feel a little more secure having updated examples of my work, considering the current economy.  Daily Total: $175 Day Two 8:45 a.m. — I wake up later than usual for my day. Luckily, I’m working from home right now, so I don’t have to commute. I do my hair and pull on a pair of jeans (I’ve worn leggings for about a month straight and have decided I need the structure that I get from rigid denim). I smear on Dr. Jart BB cream ($39). The cream has SPF 45 in it and makes my skin look better on video calls (small wins!). On top of that I apply SUPERGOOP!’s Glow Stick sunscreen ($25). I’m truly all about protection. 1 p.m. — Quarantining with your partner has its perks. I sneak away during our lunch break for a little afternoon delight. I’m a huge fan of using Dame’s hands-free, couple vibrator, the Eva II. It usually costs $135, but I won it in a sex-positive raffle hosted by Girls on Film, so it was free for me (yippee!). My partner and I have been living together for a few years, but I was initially worried about being stuck indoors with each other 24/7 while quarantining. It’s actually been pretty great. We communicate when we need space, but, mostly, it’s been fun to have all this time just the two of us. In normal times, our schedules are jam packed with adulting duties and activities. Now, it feels we’re closer than ever (metaphorically and physically). 7 p.m. — Currently tackling War & Peace, a 1,200 page monolith of a novel. I borrowed it from a relative for free. I’ve been following the virtual pandemic book club started by Yiyun Li called #TolstoyTogether, which I heard about on the New Yorker Radio Hour’s episode “War and Peace and Pandemic.” This has been a good challenge for me, considering I have plenty of time to read it these days. I’m a huge fan of physical books versus reading on my Kindle. Maybe because it feels more like a victory to carry around such a (literally) heavy read. Plus, it doubles a dumbbell in a pinch! I always feel good after spending hours reading, especially a new book (well, new to me). It’s one of the few things I do for myself without feeling guilty about it afterwards. Daily Total: $64Day Three 1 p.m. — I pay off the last of my medical bills during lunch ($1,750). It’s a lot, but it’s nice to finally pay it off after an emergency surgery caught me off guard in February. I could rant about the current medical industry, but I’m lucky I had access to good care, thanks to my insurance. I went a long time without coverage, and it constantly hung over me like a dark cloud. Now I know I can go to the doctor if I need it, which has helped me make my physical well-being a priority. 6:30 p.m. — I try to go for a walk every day, even if it’s only to the edge of the property and back. It’s usually the only exercise I prioritize, and it allows me to soak up some vitamin D. I spend most of my time in front of a laptop — either for work, writing projects, or to binge TV, so this is one of the only times throughout the day that my body changes position. If I can’t go outside because of the weather, I try to do some yoga poses. I’ve been practicing yoga for over ten years, and I was pleasantly surprised when I remembered all the flows and sun salutations on my own, despite being separated from my local studio, which is currently closed due to the coronavirus crisis.9 p.m. — Time for a Netflix Party with my best friend. I set this up through the free Google Chrome feature, which aligns our screens, so when I pause, her screen pauses too. Tonight, we watch Married at First Sight. So much drama. We’re both fans of reality TV, and use this opportunity to scream at our laptops like we were watching a sports game. Very therapeutic. We typically talk on the phone at least once a week, but this is time to just blow off steam rather than use each other for free therapy (although she is the best sounding board in the world — just don’t tell my actual therapist that).Daily Total: $1,750Day Four 8:30 a.m. — I floss my teeth. This may seem like a small feat, but it’s been a years-long struggle to incorporate it into my routine. It’s gotten to the point where I have to lie to my dentist about it. (The shame!) Although I know it’s important, I never take the time for it because it’s just so easy to skip. I’m constantly cutting out self-care. I tend to prioritize spending time with friends because they bring me so much joy. As terrible as the pandemic has been, time in quarantine has forced me to carve out space for me to explore how I can bring joy to myself. Today, I’m trying to take a very small step by starting my day focusing on me (and my gums). 7 p.m. — My partner and I make our very own specialty burgers on a Hamilton Beach indoor grill ($67.99). We grill beef patties and make homemade guacamole (healthy fats!) to top it off. I understand the need to stay inside, but moments like this make me nostalgic for picnics and grilling at parks. Still, a delicious and fun dinner overall. We already had all the groceries on hand.9 p.m. — For Christmas, I was given a MasterClass subscription, and I love trying new workshops in the evening. I watch RuPaul’s class on self-expression and authenticity, as well as a TED Talk on the lack of visibility of the bisexual community. I recently came out, but every day it’s a challenge to embrace my identity, especially during quarantine, when I can’t visit queer spaces or gay bars. It has been a long road of believing in myself and exploring what queerness means to me. Following other queer people’s experiences has helped a lot with my mental wellness. For example, the stories shared with the It Gets Better Project are uplifting reminders that I don’t have to have all the answers right now. Though the organization focuses its audience on LGBTQ+ youth, some days it feels like I’m a teenager going through sexual exploration all over again. It makes me feel less alone in my experience because there are a lot of people out there like me. Daily Total: $67.99 Day Five5 p.m. — I order groceries via Instacart, a grocery delivery service, and put on a homemade mask to receive it from the delivery person. The bill comes to $175 for at least two weeks of food for two people. We don’t own a car, so the bulk of our groceries have come from delivery. We’re very grateful for the people who are putting themselves at risk, and try to tip with that in mind. We often shop for basics, but like to fit in at least one or two daring recipes each week to change it up. 6:30 p.m. — I have been working with a trauma therapist weekly via Headway for a $35 copay. My sessions have always been virtual so the pandemic hasn’t really affected our time together. I was diagnosed with PTSD, so we tend to focus on large-ticket items like my symptoms, or we work towards healing from the past, rather than on the day-to-day. This time in the week is always massively challenging. I’m usually drained after, and looking forward to a glass of red wine. 10 p.m. — For fun, I write a short story about two friends meeting after a long time apart. I’m usually more interested in nonfiction writing, but it’s been good to get out of my head and play around with my creativity. I love writing because the characters in all my pieces — real and fictional — let me widen my understanding of the human spirit. I watch a few MasterClass lessons from the author Joyce Carol Oates on writing short stories. Then I try a few of the writing exercises she assigns, such as “Burn through a scene” where you write for 45 minutes as fast possible without stopping to edit yourself. I fall asleep on the couch with my fingers on the keypad of my laptop. Daily Total: $210Day Six8 a.m. — Thank God it’s Friday! I drag my laptop into bed with me to do some work before I officially start the day at 9 a.m. I’m lucky to have a job I can do remotely, and I meet daily with my team. It’s kinda nice to have a reason to put a shirt on in the morning, even if it’s just for our video calls. We spend the first 20 minutes checking in with each other, and my boss asks what we’re doing to stay sane. It’s a very supportive environment, which I truly appreciate. We then dive into what we’ve been working on and what we need from each other to complete our tasks. 6:30 p.m. — I go for a long walk after work and then stay outside to write while the weather is still good. I manage to write a very rough draft of a personal essay and even scribble about my day in my journal. I feel best after I’ve unloaded into my thin Moleskine notebook ($15 for a pack of three). I carry it everywhere with me in case I want to catch a stray thought I might find interesting later.  9 p.m. — I finish the week off with a box of mac and cheese, and the premiere of Alice Wu’s The Half of It on Netflix, which I subscribe to for $8.99 a month. The movie is brilliant. Women of color! LGBTQ+ representation! I highly recommend this romance. I really miss going to the movie theater to watch a new release, so having a flick to see on the day it’s released is a thrill I haven’t felt in a while. The macaroni is comforting, and less work than the complicated dishes we usually cook up. It’s not the same as a Friday night date — but there’s still some romance left in Netflix and chill, right? Daily Total: $23.99Day Seven 11:30 a.m. — My partner makes us omelettes with the vegetables leftover from the week, while I sit on the porch and paint my nails with an Urban Outfitters’s Saucy nail polish I bought for $5. Between each nail, I sip on a steaming cup of coffee. In our last grocery haul we bought a bag of grounded Starbucks breakfast blend for $6.99. I used to buy cappuccinos almost every day, so this new habit actually saves me money. Nothing can replace my trips to my favorite cafe, but a sprinkle of cinnamon on top eases the pain. 3 p.m. — We walk over five miles round trip to the grocery store. We try to do this on the weekend for anything we can’t get through delivery (alcohol). We spend $45 to restock our metaphorical wine cellar. We get home just before my sunscreen wears off, crack open a beer, and eat chips and dip without guilt. I figure we earned them with that long walk. Right? Right. 8 p.m. — Saturday nights have become reserved for our weekly virtual “hangouts” with friends. This quarantine ritual is something I look forward to during a time when there’s not a lot to pencil into the calendar. We usually finish a bottle of Two Buck Chuck from Trader Joe’s, which runs $2.99 a bottle. Sometimes the group plays drinking games, but mostly we just complain to each other and it’s GREAT. I love a good vent sesh.  Daily Total: $50Weekly Total: $2,340.98Reflection: At the start of the week, I was worried that I wasn’t the kind of person who could write a wellness diary. I’ve never considered myself a health nut and was expecting to be embarrassed by my lack of “wellness” activities. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised to find I spent a good amount of time prioritizing my mental health — more than I was giving myself credit for. This time in quarantine has taken a toll in many ways, but I’ve been lucky to have the space to take care of myself, cook more, write more, read more, and escape from the pressure of being constantly busy. I’ve realized that sometimes health is about the little things, like making time to floss in the morning because I wasn’t rushing to start the day. I hope I can take a few of these newfound habits back with me to the normal world when all of this is over.

We'd love to hear how you're prioritizing your mental and physical health at this time. Submit your entry here!Today: Elaine Hall leads an incredibly busy life. Just look at her resume: She's a life coach, an author, an autism and inclusion advocate, and the founder of The Miracle Project, a theater and film program for autistic children and their siblings and friends. She shares how her wellness routine keeps her calm, centered, and focused — even during the week leading up to the release of HBO’s Autism: The Sequel, which co-stars her son and premieres on April 28 at 9 p.m. EST.Location: Santa Monica, CA Occupation: Life coach and founder, executive, and artistic director The Miracle Project Day One7:00 a.m. — I wake up. My 25-year-old autistic son, Neal, is patiently waiting by my bedroom door. He motions for me to shh, then shows me the sign language for “walk.” It’s the beginning of our Sunday morning ritual — if he lets me sleep in, I will take him for a walk to Whole Foods. I quickly say my morning gratitudes, brush my teeth with Himalaya Botanique Whitening Complete Care Toothpaste ($5.99) and get dressed. I notice that Neal is still wearing the same shirt he wore to bed last night, so I gently remind him to change and brush his teeth, and I help him brush his hair. I love these close moments. I can’t believe he is almost 26 years old now. We don our face masks and outdoor protective gear to walk to Whole Foods. We usually like to get the Nugo’s gluten free dark chocolate protein bars, but since it is the fourth day of Passover, we opt for a box of Gluten Free Matzo ($5.49).On the way home, I notice a peacefulness, a calm, and a beauty in the flowers, the birds, the families dressed up standing outside of their churches for Easter Sunday. Bittersweet.8:45 a.m. — As Neal munches on his matzo, I prepare my computer for a 9:00 a.m. live stream yoga class, sponsored by Santa Monica Yoga and led by Julian Walker. (Regular classes are $20+ but these virtual classes are $15.00). I mirror my computer so that I can watch on my TV, lay out my yoga mat ($15.99) and grab a yoga block ($9.99).Julian’s classes combine slow stretch, deep breathing, mindfulness, and strengthening postures. I have been going to his classes for years. When he sees my name on the roster, he speaks directly into the screen, “It wouldn’t be Sunday yoga without Elaine here.” I smile. A little bit of normalcy within this new normal. My husband Jeff hangs with Neal while I am in my living room yoga class.12:00 p.m. — Neal’s life coach, Josh, arrives from the agency Diverse Journeys, to help Neal prepare for his week. The life coach from Diverse Journeys is covered by the State of California, through their regional center program. We are very fortunate that right now, California provides support for individuals with severe developmental disabilities like Neal. Their sessions are done at Neal's apartment, where he lives part-time with a 24/7 support roommate.Again, Neal willingly puts on his mask as they walk out the door.Jeff is a therapist, but his hobby is gourmet cooking. He’s been preparing a beautiful brunch for us: matzo brie, a traditional recipe combining milk, whipped eggs, and crushed matzo into a fluffy omelette with homemade applesauce. We spend the next hour enjoying the quiet calmness of being together. In this crazy world, we have each other.1:30 p.m. — I get the idea to surprise one of my BFF’s, Ilene, by driving by her house to wish her a happy birthday. Jeff and I stay in our car, and we chat for a few minutes to Ilene, who’s on the street. Then we sing her Happy Birthday. From a distance, her neighbor smiles.3:00 p.m. — Back home, I move some furniture out of the way to prepare for part two of Ilene’s birthday celebration: a Zoom dance party! We invite some guests to join. One of the pluses for COVID-19, last-minute invitations are welcome and most everyone is available!  Ilene gets to be the DJ so she can pick her favorite tunes. Soon friends from all over the country begin to join, coming in and out of the zoom room, as Ilene and I are dancing to everything from ABBA to Michael Jackson. What a fun way to spend the afternoon! I ask myself, “Why don’t I do this more often?”7:00 p.m. — While I’ve been dancing abandonedly around my living room, Jeff has been cooking up a storm and preparing one of his fabulous meals. Tonight, it’s Caesar salad, roasted beets, homemade chicken soup, and vegetarian lasagna with sliced zucchini instead of pasta. How lucky am I?Daily Total: $52.46Day Two7:00 a.m. —  I wake up with the sound of the birds chirping outside my window. I rarely use an alarm except when I have to catch an early morning flight, which used to be twice a month for speaking gigs. Of course right now, that’s not something I have to worry about. As soon as I open my eyes, I remind myself to take a deep breath and thank my Creator for bringing me another day.Before I can reach for my phone to read emails, I perform my morning ritual: four kundalini circles to the right, four to the left, then a brief body meditation. After this routine and a hot shower, I feel full, energized, and ready to move my body. This routine, which has long been established prior to our quarantine, has truly saved me during these challenging times.I grab my phone and try to keep it in my pocket before I do my daily reading, but I can’t help myself. It’s 7:45 a.m. and as I check my work email my jaw drops open. A producer from the Today Show has learned about The Miracle Project holding its musical theater classes for individuals with autism online, and wants to come to visit my virtual class tomorrow night!!!!  To celebrate, I brew myself some special green tea, gifted to me when I spoke at an arts therapy conference in Beijing two years ago. I am almost out of this precious elixir and since I will not be visiting China in a long time, I worry about what I’ll do when it is gone! I prepare it in a bottom dispensing teapot, given to me by a former colleague. I truly believe it’s one of the most ingenious inventions ever made.12:30 p.m. — I take a break from emails, phone calls, and texts with my office to have lunch with my husband. Lunch is something even I can make! I grab a handful of pre-washed organic, protein-rich greens, chop up some romaine lettuce and the now-cold roasted beets from last night’s meal, add some cucumber and cherry tomatoes, and voila! We have a salad. (That amounts to about $14 in produce, but we already had it in our pantry from our last trip to Trader Joe’s.) Sprinkle salt, pepper, garlic, a few splashes of lemon juice, vinegar, and oil and we have a deliciously fresh salad dressing!We spend this precious time together, and he reads me what he has written in his creative writing class, something he has started doing since the quarantine via Zoom. I step outside for a breath of fresh air. Sometimes I can go all day without realizing there’s an outside outside.6:00 p.m. — Time for a Zoom meeting with my team from The Miracle Project to discuss the upcoming visit from the Today Show. We work through some glitches and make a plan. I don’t get off the computer until 8:30 p.m.Jeff has prepared leftovers from the night before, adding in Asian vegetables to his homemade chicken soup. Although I’ve promised not to eat after 8:00 p.m., tonight I enjoy the great food and his company; they’re the perfect way to wind down from a productive and intense day.Daily Total: $0Day Three11:30 a.m. — Before COVID-19, I went to a jazz dance class every Monday and Tuesday morning taught by Jill Strauss at the Electric Lodge in Venice, CA. This was not just physical fitness for me. It was community, it was connection, it was my therapy. To say I’ve been missing it is an understatement. My body, my soul, my entire being, longed for these movements. Today, Jill offered her classes to all of her former students for free on Zoom. (Typically they cost $20 per class to $17 if you buy a series.) After class, I feel like a new person. I reconnected with my body, my soul, my dance community... and I’m ready to face the day.4:30 p.m. — Usually before any type of TV or public appearance, I would get a manicure, have my roots covered, get a facial, and sometimes even have my make up done. Well, we are in COVID-19 times so it’s up to me to look camera ready!Fortunately, I have the products I need. I wash my face with Verabella’s Honey Almond Oatmeal scrub ($38), then use the Firming Mint Mask ($48) to, well, firm. Looking pretty good for a stay at home facial! Now the hard part, the hair. I have very fine hair and whenever I attempt a blow dry, it comes out flat and stringy. I pull out my Conair Easy Start Hot Rollers, ($40) and begin to roll.  While the curlers are cooling off, I start on my makeup. First, I apply a skin-calming primer from  Colorscience ($49), then a mineral-based organic blush from INIKA ($48.99) and a mineral-based eye shadow from Colorscience ($49) which has 4 shades to make the “perfect’ smokey eye.  Make-up complete, dressed in my Miracle Project t-shirt, I remove my hot rollers, touch up my roots with brush-on root powder, let the curls fall as they wish, and in the immortal words of Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard, I mutter to myself, “Mr. Demille, I am ready for my close up!” 6:00 p.m. — I’m on the Zoom meeting with The Miracle Project staff and Carly Marsh, the producer from the Today Show. Before every class, we always do a mindfulness grounding meditation to get present, focused, and allow our highest selves to be available for ourselves and our students. Tonight is no different. When we prepare internally, the external takes care of itself.6:15 p.m. — The students arrive, excited to see each other on Zoom, and we check in. “This isolation has been hard, I’ve had a fever for two weeks and can’t be out of my bedroom, but when I see all of you guys on my computer, I feel like I am less alone,” says a young adult with autism. All of the technical pre-planning the night before was worth it — the interview is a success. The classes are going so well that we have decided to open up virtual dance, music, and other classes to people around the world. Daily Total: $272.99Day Four7:00 a.m. — The birds are chirping, but I’m not so chirpy. I was so wired from the success of class last night that I couldn’t fall asleep. I’ve never been much of a sleeper, actually. When I was a little girl, my Dad, who was a trained hypnotherapist, used to help me get back to sleep using visualization and relaxation techniques. I prided myself on writing the majority of my first book, my memoir Now I See the Moon, from the hours of 2:00 a.m to 5:00 a.m.A few months ago, knowing my peculiar sleep habits, Jeff bought me the book Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker ($18.85). As important as Dr. Seuss’ book was for me as a child, Why We Sleep is a life saver during this COVID-19 crisis. Sleep is the most important preventative medicine we can give to ourselves.I guide myself to go back to sleep and start the day again at 9:30 a.m. 12:30 p.m. — I move slowly through the day and allow myself to feel the joy of last night’s accomplishment. I’m so proud of how we were able to get our Zoom classes up and running in less than a week so that our families would not feel alone during this challenging time.I am filled with excitement and pride! And I know I need to really practice my self care. Soon, HBO will be airing the film Autism: The Sequel, which profiles my son and four other young adults on the spectrum as they navigate what independence means to them and manage both challenges and triumphs as adults living on the autism spectrum. With all the excitement, and trying to just keep our small non-profit running, I have been working 12 to 14 hour days since the beginning of our quarantine. I need to slow down.6:00 p.m. — It is the last night of Passover. In honor of my heritage, I choose to take-out food from Fromins, our neighborhood deli. I call and order a whitefish sandwich, cole slaw, and steamed spinach ($38). I ask them to hold the bread and add matzo instead. It’s the first time I have ordered take-out since all of this began. I don my mask and outdoor garb and stand in line, six feet away from others as I wait for my meal. I’m handed my order, and I thank the woman at the counter for being of service during this challenging time.When I return home, I reflect on one of the core messages of Passover, freedom. Passover traditionally celebrates the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt. Each year, we are tasked to feel as if we were once slaves; to have empathy for others who might be today enslaved by injustice or prejudice and knowing that in any generation, if one person is not free, none of us are free. In the mystical tradition, we are invited to reflect what is our personal enslavement? How do we keep ourselves back from being true to our essential selves? How can we be freed from this internal oppression? And in this time of COVD-19, in what ways are we still free? To offer a smile to someone, to share our love and support, to eat delicious food.Daily Total: $56.85Day Five7:30 a.m. — It is the last day of Passover, a day that, in my tradition, calls upon us to remember our deceased family members and say a prayer. Last night I lit candles that will burn for 24 hours to honor my dear father, mother, my former mother-in-law, and one of my best friends who have long been gone. I added a candle for the thousands of people who have lost their lives to the virus.9:00 a.m. — Usually I will attend services at my local synagogue to gather with others to say traditional prayers. I am concerned that I will not have this opportunity, and then I hear of Ikar, a progressive synagogue that will be doing services through Zoom, from Julia Moss, the advancement director from The Miracle Project. She’s a member of Ikar and sent me the link for the services.By singing the songs of my youth along with Cantor and joining the others virtually, I participate in this holiday in one of the most meaningful ways I can ever imagine.Daily Total: $0Day Six7:00 a.m. — I begin my morning routine: breathing, thanking, meditating and stretching. I read from my daily dose of The Tao of Joy Every Day: 365 Days of Tao Living by Derke Lin ($4.99 for Kindle version). Today’s reading is about simplicity.Today is also the anniversary of my dear father’s passing. My father was able to find joy in everything, every situation.12:30 p.m. —  A while ago, I had a private health assessment with Dr. Kaymar Hedayat, who gives me supplement recommendations that I receive today: Lipoic Acid Supreme ($40.75), Myco Botanicals Brain Supporting Mental Clarity ($25.95); a Bone and Wellness tincture ($215.63); and Gluconic DMG by DaVinci Laboratories ($61.40). They come every three months.Jeff has gone shopping at Costco spending around $260 on groceries.5:00 p.m. — I tune back into Ikar for their Friday night service. A festive hour of music, story, and prayer.6:00 p.m. — Neal and Josh join us for dinner. Jeff has prepared a cucumber and sesame seed salad, miso yaki sea bass, grilled asparagus, and baked Japanese sweet potato. Our neighbor brought over homemade lemon curd and croissant. A wonderful way to end our matzo-eating eight days.Having Neal over for the weekend brings great joy, as his coach shares the week they had together. Jeff had found a box of construction masks in the garage and Neal and Josh went to UCLA Hospital to give to the first responders there. I was so proud of him.6:45 p.m. — We light Shabbat candles with Rabbi Naomi Levy, my rabbi from Nashuva who guides us through a most meaningful meditation on Facebook Live. These extra spiritual practices are so important to keep the positive spirit alive.Daily Total: $608.72Day Seven7:00 a.m. — Saturday, a day of rest. Neal and I take a walk to look at the lavender flowers. We both enjoy the scent of the lavender, and he alone enjoys watching the bees. Neal has always loved bees. So much so that he can pick them up, look at them, smell them, and then let them fly away. I used to try to stop him for doing this, fearing he would get stung. But he never did. He is sort of the bee whisperer. I think they must sense his kindness, his awe, and his respect for their being.I cherish these days with Neal and am reminded of the times that he was so sensory sensitive that he could not even walk out of the house. Today, he is an emissary for autism, receiving national awards, walking red carpets with movie stars, being a semi-professional model and actor, and presenting with me at the United Nations while using his iPad to speak for him. Before the quarantine, Neal had two part time jobs, the first helping to pick and bottle organic spices at an organic garden, known Shemesh Farms, and the other at the Farms Grocery Store on Montana Avenue.I am reminded to look at life’s blessings and to remember that they are abundant now.9:30 p.m. — After Neal goes to sleep, Jeff and I tune into HBO to watch a comedy. And — what?!!! We see the trailer for Autism: The Sequel airing on HBO, and there is Neal’s photo! Pinch me, is this real?Daily Total: $0. Time with my family, priceless. Weekly Total: $991.02Reflection: I cannot do the work that I do, be the mother and wife that I am, without making my overall wellness and my wellness routine the most important thing in my life. When I sleep, meditate, drink lots of water, stretch, and read uplifting books and articles, I find gratitude in all aspects of life. The best parts of my week were my dinners with Neal and Jeff. The connection, the food, the love made me ever so grateful."

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A master meal prepper whose wellness practice is centered around sustainability.Age: 27Location: Astoria, New YorkOccupation: Small online business ownerSalary: $50,000Day One: 7:00 a.m. — I quickly brush my teeth and put my contacts in before my partner gets in the shower. We both ditched our disposable plastic toothbrushes for Philips Sonicare electric ones ($69.99 each) a few months ago, and I love that this part of my routine creates a little less plastic waste. While my partner showers, I drink some cold brew, which I need before working out. A year ago, we invested in a gallon-sized mason jar cold brew maker ($35) from Amazon that allows us to brew amazing coffee at home. While we’ve always been “reusable mug” people (it’s a thing, I swear!) to cut down on plastic coffee cups. Plus, brewing at home has saved us hundreds of dollars on coffee, since we’re just buying beans. We’re obsessed. If it weren’t for coronavirus, I’d be heading to my gym, New York Sports Club (it’s normally $39 per month, but they’ve only been charging me $9.99 per month during this lockdown), right about now. As a small online business owner, I’ve always worked from home. However, I used to carve out an hour at the beginning of the day to walk to the gym and work out. It was an essential for my mental health. Now, I do a quick yoga flow (with lots of chest and hip-opening poses) or some bodyweight exercises (I can do squats and lunges all day) that I’ve memorized before starting my day to avoid jumping right into work. Moving before work absolutely makes a difference in my overall mood and productivity. Even though I’m eager to start answering emails, I know it’s important. 12:30 p.m. — It’s lunchtime. My business has to do with meal-prepping and planning, so I’m not just on the “meal prep train,” I’m basically the conductor. I pull a hearty slice of my chicken, rice, broccoli, and cheese casserole out of a square glass container. The YEBODA container set I have costs $20. I heat it up in the microwave, close my computer, and enjoy it. I whipped it up yesterday, but it still tastes fresh and delicious. I really can’t talk it up enough, so I have to reiterate: I love meal prepping — it’s always helped me keep grocery costs down and our meals generally cost a total of $3 per serving.Sometimes I find it hard to eat without distractions, but I know doing it helps my body register that it actually consumed something delicious, so I try to not look at my phone or computer as I chow down.10:30 p.m. — Bed. I used to struggle with sleep maintenance insomnia (that’s when falling asleep is easy, but staying asleep isn’t), and leaving my phone on my bedside table only made it worse. So a few months ago, I started putting my phone to “bed” in the living room. It never felt right to just leave it lying around outside the bedroom, so I turned parting with it for the night into a ritual. I made a little sleeping bag-like thing out of a scarf, set it on the TV stand and now literally tuck my phone in before going to sleep. There’s something nice about a ritual that clearly defines when phone time is over. When I get into my own bed, I fire up my Kindle ($89) and continue reading Where The Forest Meets The Stars by Glendy Vanderah. I’m halfway in and not sure if I like it yet, but it’s so easy to read. If I have two bad nights in a row, I take half of a 10 mg CBD and melatonin gummy from Charlotte’s Web. I bought a tub a few months ago ($44.99) and absolutely love them. However, I don’t rely on them for sleep more than once or twice per week. Tonight is not one of those nights, as my sleeping patterns have been surprisingly very normal during this pandemic. Daily Total: $223.98 Day Two3:15 p.m. — My partner and I make our weekly batch of oat milk. It’s a fun activity that we bond over, ever since my partner became obsessed with oat milk a few months ago. It’s that creamy texture! Instead of buying it in cartons every week, which was $5.99 per half gallon, we’ve been making small batches by blending oats. We already had all the ingredients on hand this week.To make oat milk, all you have to do is blend one cup of oats (we buy oats in bulk at Costco — it usually comes to around $10 for five pounds) with three to four cups of water, ¼ teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of maple syrup or sugar. Then we strain it a few times. That’s it! We keep it in a jar in the fridge for five days and use it in smoothies, in hot chocolate, or when enjoying homemade chocolate chip cookies. 4:30 p.m. — I’m partially relieved that I’m off the hook when it comes to commuting for my bi-weekly therapy session. I never love coming into Manhattan. Luckily, my therapist, whom I’ve been seeing for a year now, is offering Zoom sessions. We’re continuing our regular routine of hour-long meetings every other week. Each session costs $100 after insurance. I am so grateful I have someone outside of my friends, partner, and family to confide in during this time. Zoom therapy isn’t exactly easy, because even though I have plenty of privacy, it’s weird having my partner in the vicinity. Instead of continuing our conversations about my parents, which is what we focused on during in-person sessions (I know, cliche, but that’s where we’re at!), we mainly talk about the coronavirus and its effects on my mental health. My therapist constantly reminds me to “be in my body” and connect to my breath, which I always struggle with as a very go-go-go type of person. I need to keep in mind that everything we need to feel grounded is already within us — even when everything is up in the air. Daily Total: $100Day Three2:00 p.m. — Time to make some more cold brew! I got a delivery of new coffee beans from a subscription I use called Bottomless. The subscription is $5 per month plus $13 for every bag of coffee, we go through about two or three per month bringing our total coffee spend to $60/month for two people.I grind up some beans in our grinder, and prepare the cold brew by putting all the grounds in the filter and adding water. I’m not a huge coffee snob, but I love knowing that this process is cutting down potential plastic waste significantly. Plus, it’s a nice break from work! 8:30 p.m. — Lately I do grocery shopping late on Friday night to avoid the crowds amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I bring my grocery cart with me (it was well worth $40 it cost, because I always have a haul) along with reusable mesh produce bags ($10) to avoid using plastic bags during my trip. (You’ll see a theme in my life: when it comes to plastic, avoid, avoid, avoid!) Thanks to being a great planner, I’m in and out of the store within 15 minutes. My groceries are different every week, but I always get sweet potatoes, onions, bananas, and eggs. These are ingredients I tend to use no matter what’s on the menu. Normally, we spend $30 per week on groceries, thanks to bulk-shopping at Costco once a month. It usually comes to $100 per month, plus a $65 per year membership (or $1.25 per month). However because of the outbreak, our routine has changed and we go to a local store. We’re also buying way more groceries. I end up spending $75 for us for this whole week.When I get home, I wipe down all packaged groceries with multipurpose wipes. They’re nothing special, and I don’t love how much waste we create while sanitizing groceries, but it’s necessary at this point. Daily Total: $144.25Day Four9:00 a.m. — My partner and I do yoga together. It’s Saturday morning, so luckily we can slow it down a bit. Our apartment doesn’t have the best set up for two people to stretch out, but we make it work. We throw on a free YouTube video that doesn’t look too intimidating and flow. I find my practice is way more enjoyable when I have a buddy! This sets us up for an easy and relaxing Saturday in quarantine. 5:00 p.m. — Whenever I cook, I try to make it special. It’s really my creative outlet, so I always feel at home when I’m in the kitchen. I start preparing #TheStew (this is a recipe for Spiced Chickpea Stew With Coconut and Turmeric by Alison Roman that literally went viral). I’m putting my own twist on it, using veggie stock I made myself with veggie scraps (free). I keep it frozen in a Souper Cubes tray ($20), which are such great organizational tools for food in my freezer. I take all scraps I create while I’m cooking and freeze them for future veggie stock. That, or I compost them, which keeps our food waste extremely low. We bought a FCMP tumbling compost bin ($99) about a year ago, and stuck it behind our car in our parking spot. It helps us harvest dirt from our own food scraps, which we’re now using for a window sill garden. It’s the coolest feeling to be able to do this in the concrete jungle that is New York, and cook with food we grew in our apartment from soil we made. My partner and I enjoy slurping up our stew together tonight over rice while drinking beer and watching Mr. Robot on Amazon Prime ($119 per year). Daily Total: $238Day Five10:00 a.m. — I told you I was crazy about meal-prepping, and now it’s finally that time of the week. I’ve practiced this ritual for about five years, and I fully believe it's a form of self-care. To make it feel even more fun, I like to turn on some throwback tunes (I love 90’s rap and hip hop as well as the Rolling Stones). It’s all courtesy of Spotify ($15 per month). I also usually drink something special while I’m cooking. Today, it’s an iced matcha from my local coffee shop that’s still operating, even during the coronavirus lockdown. My coffee shop set up a great little booth that separates the workers from customers via plexiglass. You can order through a little speaker box and just stick your credit card in the machine. The barista pushes your drinks out through an opening, and that’s that. I’m really happy I don’t have to do this quarantine without this weekly treat ($5.50). Normally, I bring my re-usable Stojo cup ($20), but they’re not allowing us to bring our own mugs now for safety reasons. I’m still not used to going out wearing an organic cotton mask, which I got from the eco-friendly goods maker Etee for $30 (the price includes shipping and mask donations). 3:30 p.m. — It’s nice out, and I’ve been in the kitchen for four hours already, so it’s time to take a break. Right now, with the virus, the only thing I can really do outside is walk. We’re lucky to live near a park, so I open up Audible ($15 per month) and take my usual route along the water and through the sloping lawns for about a half hour. I’m just about done listening to a book called Building A StoryBrand by Donald Miller (I love business books) which takes my mind off of how scared I am to be crossing paths with other people on my walk. I try to keep my distance. It feels so good to get fresh air. Daily Total: $85.50Day Six 8:00 a.m. — My daily yoga flow is getting boring, so I switch to a workout program I’ve done on and off for awhile called TL Method. (It’s normally $29 per month for the program, but it’s free for me, because I’m good friends with the founder.) I used to do these workouts at the gym, pre-corona but it’s not exactly ideal to do in my apartment. Still, I try. I roll out my old yoga mat and do a bodyweight workout barefoot in my favorite Lululemon outfit, which I’ve been wearing during workouts for six years. Investing in quality workout clothes and equipment is a sustainable choice since I almost never need to replace them.The TL Method helps keep workouts interesting by mixing things up. I choose a 30-minute full body workout and modify moves that require equipment as needed, since I don’t have any. I love dynamic bodyweight exercises where I really have to focus on coordination or balance, like single-leg deadlifts or Russian get-ups. I don’t really like working out at home because there are so many distractions. It’s hard to get going. But once my workout is over, I feel my anxiety and stress melt away.7:45 p.m. —  While my partner attends his online grad school classes, I take a moment to myself to set the mood and paint my nails while watching reality TV. I light the one candle we have (we’re just not big candle people), which we bought while visiting my parents near a cute little waterfront town on Long Island. I get my nail file, top coat, and favorite Essie nail polish (it’s called Muchi, Muchi and it’s $9) and give myself a mini manicure while watching The Bachelor: Listen To Your Heart. I’m really not sure what I’d do without my Hulu subscription ($11 per month). Daily Total: $20Day Seven 4:00 p.m. — Our ButcherBox finally arrived! We love getting meat from this subscription service for a variety of reasons. Cost is one of the biggest things for me and I love that the meat is sourced sustainably. A custom box with six items ($149) lasts us at least three months. Inside our box is a couple steaks, some ground beef, chicken breasts, and a whole chicken. There is something about being able to butcher a whole chicken all on my own that makes me feel Zen. I use every part for stock and future cooking. I take my time, carefully cutting out the breasts, thighs, and wings until I finally have a carcass to make stock with. My Misen Chef’s Knife ($65) makes this process easy.  In my household, my homemade chicken stock is basically liquid gold. It makes everything taste better and I love that I don’t have to buy it in cartons from the grocery store. I get a big pot going on the stove in my favorite Cuisinart Chef’s Stockpot ($50), and the apartment smells amazing. 8:00 p.m. — My partner has class again, so I take the opportunity to take a long (for me) shower. Normally, I’m in and out in five minutes since I only wash my thick, curly hair once per week (it’s a perk that it conserves water). I’m currently trying out this eco-friendly shampoo called Ethique ($16), which comes as a bar instead of in a bottle. So far, I like it. My hair is perpetually crazy and frizzy no matter which shampoo I use (eco-friendly or not). I have yet to find a sustainable conditioner that works for me, so I’m using Deva ($26) for now.After my shower, I prepare some Swiss Miss hot chocolate, made with warmed oat milk. It’s so delicious. I often find cuddling up with my partner and a cocoa is the best part of my day. Daily Total: $306Weekly Total: $1,117.73Reflection: I’d like to add more time for wellness practices into my routine, especially while stuck at home during the coronavirus lockdown. Normally, I get more manicures, plus indulge in the occasional spa treatment and get my legs waxed. But now that none of those are options, I need to get more creative about self-care. I do find that it’s easy to introduce the eco-friendly versions of my favorite wellness activities into my life, and I’m so glad I’ve been journeying down this path to a more sustainable lifestyle. It gives me peace. Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!"

I work for a college doing Case Management and Wellness Education, which I love. Students can come to me if they’re struggling, and I provide support to them and point them to appropriate resources. I’m an introvert and was looking forward to working from home, but I’m having a hard time getting into the swing of things. I’ve woken up really anxious lately, which I’m assuming is related to the pandemic. I put my AirPods in and pull up the ""Meditation Studio"" App ($9/month). I try to use the app almost every day to meditate. I play one of my favorite meditations, “Start Your Day” led by Franko Heke. 12 p.m. — My fiancé is working from home as well, and we're attempting to figure out our “new normal.” We're supposed to get married in July but with the coronavirus pandemic going on, we're not so sure what's going to happen.Last evening, we participated in the #GreatAmericanTakeOut and got takeout from our favorite Italian restaurant in town. They will be forced to close for dine-in customers starting today as a result of the state instructions from the governor, so we wanted to support them as much as possible. I have some leftovers (chicken and veggies in a white wine sauce) for lunch, chug a La Croix, and head back to the office (a.k.a. my bedroom). 6 p.m. — We usually eat dinner around 6. I’ve been doing WW for about 14 months now ($20/month for digital version). I started in an attempt to eat healthier, and form some healthier habits overall, and it really works for me. I’m a mindless snacker, so I try to commit to not eating after 7 p.m. We take our dog for an evening walk and come back to watch ""Tiger King"" on Netflix. I am so intrigued by Joe Exotic!Daily Total: $29Day Two8 a.m. — I’ve been starting my mornings by reading a passage from The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living, by Ryan Holiday ($25). This morning’s reading was about how there is “Philosophy in Everything.” Reading from this book every morning has truly changed how I live my life and sets me up with good intentions to start my day. 12:30 p.m. — I head back to my old faithful meditation app, Meditation Studio. I pick a new meditation today, “Tough Times” by Patricia Karpas. For added effect, I swipe some of my favorite CBD roll-on on my wrists, neck and temples. I love Blue Ridge Hemp’s “Breathe Easy and Concentrate” ($20). I’ve been using it for a couple of years now. 7 p.m. — I got an Amazon package this afternoon — the Schick dermaplaning razors I ordered ($5). I’ve heard good things about dermaplaning but am scared to shave my face! I’m part Italian and having extra hair has been an issue throughout my life. I use the facial razor on my jawline and under my ears. What a difference! It feels strange after. Maybe some slight stubble, even? Daily Total: $50Day Three8 a.m. — I wake up with a slight headache. I think all of the extra screen time from working remotely is affecting me. I chug some water and take my dog outside for a walk. It’s beautiful out!12 p.m. — My fiancé and I have been talking about getting a second dog for some time now. We have one dog, a cavalier King Charles spaniel named Henry, who we think gets lonely during the day. We're both working mostly remotely as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and he said earlier in the week that now is the perfect time to “add to the family.” He has to go into the office on Thursdays and Fridays, so I wasn't expecting him home on his lunch break today. But he walked in with a new puppy! Our new dog is a chocolate cocker spaniel named Otis. Day = made!7 p.m. — We got a fire pit and s’mores set as one of my bridal shower gifts from my two childhood best friends. The weather is still perfect outside, so we sit outside and enjoy each other’s company. He went to work in the office today, so I missed him!Daily Total: $0Day Four9 a.m. — I “slept in” this morning. I had pre-registered for my favorite workout class: a hip hop dance class. I attended classes at my local studio a couple times recently and have fallen in love with it. Each morning, my studio sends a Vimeo link to all who sign up ($5/class). I hate to admit it, but I enjoy working out in private more. I can make a fool of myself to a rap song and not worry about anyone looking at me! I was dripping in sweat when the class was over. I was in a great mood the rest of the day. 12 p.m. — We supported our favorite sandwich shop by placing an order for pickup: two genoa salami sandwiches on french bread ($22). I felt good knowing that we were supporting our favorite local business as well as social distancing. 3 p.m. — A local farm in our area has a “drop in” program. They have tons of beautiful flowers out in a shed and you can take what you want, as long as you Venmo or leave cash — honor system. It’s social distancing compliant. I paid $15 for a large mason jar filled with different varieties of roses. 5 p.m. — Today is my best friend’s 29th birthday. We planned a surprise happy hour for her via Zoom because all of our friends couldn’t get together during quarantine. I drank my favorite beer (Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat, which was already in the fridge) and loved seeing faces I hadn’t seen in a while. We all hung out while getting buzzed in our own homes. For an introvert like me, that’s a win! Daily Total: $42Day Five9 a.m. — I work a few shifts a month at our local hospital doing assessments for people experiencing a mental health crisis. I’m scheduled to work this afternoon. I haven’t worked this job since COVID-19 started, and I’m nervous about it. I woke up this morning with my heart racing. I opened up my laptop and started a Yoga with Adriene video (free). She helped me calm down. Thank you, Adriene! 12 p.m. — I grab some sesame chicken ($11) from my favorite Chinese restaurant to bring to work. While the breaded chicken isn’t the best on #WW, I have tons of points left to use for the week. I love this program. 11 p.m. — Off of work! I LOVE my work and really enjoy my coworkers… But I’m always amped up when I leave the hospital to go home.  Playing with my dogs and chatting with my fiancé both help me settle down tonight. I put some lavender essential oil in my diffuser and pass out. Daily Total: $11Day Six9 a.m. — So starts week two of working remotely in the same house as my fiancé. We have a pretty good set up: He works upstairs, I work downstairs. I put on CNN when I wake up and quickly get anxious because of all of the COVID-19 coverage. I worry about my dad and sisters, who have been working in New York City. I take a walk outside to clear my head. 12 p.m. — A day of virtual meetings with students. I love my job! I had some troubles with the microphone not working on my Macbook. I have been resisting getting a headset but think I may have to cave. I pop some of yesterday’s sesame chicken into the microwave and enjoy lunch with my fiancé and our dogs. The new puppy is full of energy and was barking during my calls this morning. He’s lucky he’s cute! 6:30 p.m. — I have been trying to avoid going to the grocery store. But almost all of our food is gone, so it’s time! I run into a good friend who I haven’t been able to see face to face in a few weeks. We chat (six feet apart). It’s so good to see a familiar face. My favorite Malbec is on major sale — score! I also pick up some veggies, a new candle, and some ground turkey to make turkey burgers and taco salads this week. ($33)Daily Total: $33Day Seven9 a.m. — I have a remote meeting with 30 of my coworkers today. We all check in with each other during the meeting and it brings a smile to my face to see all of them in their homes. They all ask about the new puppy (who is taking a nap during this call, thankfully). 12 p.m. — My fiancé and I are supposed to get married in July. With COVID-19, we’ve suspected for a while that we will probably have to postpone the wedding. But even though I’d figured this would happen, today it finally hit me — we’re really going to have to postpone. I cried and cried. We talked about how lucky we were to be healthy and safe, and that this is only temporary.  Then we sat on our couch and finished “Tiger King.” Joe Exotic made me feel better. 8 p.m. — I started re-reading The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle ($16) for what feels like the tenth time. I need to work on being more in the “present,” especially during this pandemic. This book brings me such peace. I read for an hour before my eyes start to get heavy. Daily Total: $16Weekly Total: $181Reflection: Taking time to meditate had the most positive impact on my week. When I am taking care of myself, all aspects of life are better. I’m kinder, I’m happier, and I feel more centered. I’m striving to better myself in all nine dimensions of wellness (emotional, spiritual, interpersonal, financial, cultural, intellectual, environmental, occupational and physical). And the new puppy helps too!"

Submit your entry here!Today: A woman who’s trying to prioritize self-care while navigating social distancing and the anxiety that comes with the COVID-19 pandemic. She escapes New York to quarantine with her family. Age: 25Location: New York NYSalary: $39,000 Occupation: Writer Editor's Note: This diary was recorded before cities mandated social distancing and shelter-in-place rules.Day One 7:30 am — I roll over and check the news for the latest NYC coronavirus count — It’s March 13 and more than a hundred cases are already confirmed. Typically, I give myself 30 minutes “sans technology” when I wake up, but since the virus hit, I’ve been checking every update. I pour myself a homemade cold brew and head down to the free gym in my building for a 45-minute elliptical sweat session. It’s still open through all the COVID-19 madness, thank God! I injured my IT band several weeks after a half-marathon in December, so strength training and cycling seem to be the only ways I can still get my heart-rate up without running. I fit in 15 minutes of arm and ab exercises, then head upstairs for a shower, a banana, and a big spoonful of almond butter, which I already have on-hand from my last Trader Joe’s trip. Now it’s time to reserve my place on the couch with my other two roommates who are also working from home. Today is my first day working out of the office, and I’m trying to decide if I prefer getting things done from my couch or at the kitchen table. My roommates and I turned our bedrooms into conference rooms to take calls. It gets the job done. 1:30 p.m. — I’m no Fifth Harmony, and I’m already starting to feel like I can’t WFH. I already looted the fridge looking for snacks. I hid the remote to avoid feeding my new addiction to The Outsider on HBO (my subscription is $15 per month). I decide I need a walk and food — so I’ll walk to food. I pick up Sweetgreen’s Kale Caesar, my standard order. In my book, paying $16 dollars for a bowl of lettuce is a crime, but it’s just so satisfying. Then it’s back to the couch to focus on meeting my 5 p.m. deadline. I work in editorial at a magazine, and find writing to be oddly calming and motivating, despite the current insanity of the outside world. I’m getting into a groove when my roommate runs in from her room and tells us to turn on the news for Trump’s press conference. She said there was talk of grounding domestic flights. Terrifying, considering I’m scrambling to fly back home to Atlanta to quarantine there as soon as possible. Thank God she was wrong. Time for more coffee. 7 p.m. — I’ve struggled with anxiety for many years, but recently stopped taking medication. However, the current global health climate definitely isn’t helping. I’m feeling a little anxious, so I do a 10-minute guided meditation on Headspace to ease my mind. I was gifted a free year-long membership at an event I attended for work, and I use it as often as possible when I need to wind-down. Now, it’s back to real life. As luck would have it, college spring break and COVID-19 hit right at the same time. My brother-in-law’s sister is in town for hers. Terrible timing, but I do my best to greet her and show her a good (and as sanitized as possible) time, despite my heightened anxiety. I invite her and her friend over for pre-dinner drinks. We polish off a bottle of pinot noir ($16) and catch up on family drama before heading to the West Village so she can try the world’s best vodka pizza at Rubirosa (the ‘za and a bottle of wine split three ways comes to $13.33 for me). The girls desperately want to go to another bar after dinner, so I bring them to my favorite spot for a round of martinis ($30) before I head home for a hot, soapy shower and bed. Daily Total: $63.33Day Two 10 a.m. — I am a firm believer in sleeping in on the weekends. It’s Saturday, so I give myself some time to stretch and journal before rising and pouring today’s first cup of coffee. I fix myself a cold brew and hot water with lemon, then catch up on today’s coronavirus count and the current state of the stock market. There’s so much uncertainty. I need to stop thinking about the virus, so I watch an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm while I scan Kayak for flights back to Atlanta. Please make me feel better, Latte Larry! I find a flight for $55 dollars at 5 p.m. tonight. Unreal. I book it right away and feel instantly relieved. I’ll be home in time for dinner! 1:30 p.m. — My anxiety is at an all-time high. I’m packing in a frenzy. I need to go to the pharmacy, take out the trash, clean the apartment — and, really, just calm the fuck down. I’m so nervous they’re going to cancel my flight and I’m certain that I’m packing all the wrong things. How long will I be home for anyway? Weeks? Months? Forever? I throw a year’s supply of underwear, leggings, and sports bras into my suitcase — along with all the products in my skincare routine, of course. I’m a pretty expressive person, and I have lots of smile lines and crow’s feet already as a result — I like to stay on top of those. My favorite product at the moment is Skinceuticals C E Ferulic ($166). I’ve spent way too much time in the sun and suffered countless damaging sunburns, so I’m religious now about applying this to reduce fine lines and brighten my face. Plus, I’m all about Vitamin C. I also love the Powerful-Strength Dark Circle Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum from Kiehls ($50). I see instant results when I use it in the morning. If coronavirus wants to keep me home, I’ve decided, I’ll use this time to detox and reset. I bring my Axel and Ashe journal ($40), a stack full of books, a resistance band I’ve had forever, face and eye masks, and two pairs of running shoes. No way this is under 50 pounds. My roommates are fleeing the city too, and since I don't know when we’ll return, I make an omelette to use up the last of my eggs and veggies and, as much as it pains me, toss the rest of the perishable items in my fridge in the trash. I know I need to hydrate before heading to the airport, so I fill up my 36-ounce Yeti ($50) with ice water and lemon. Water makes everything better.3:30 p.m. — One of my roommates and I were able to get on the same flight, so we split an Uber to LaGuardia (my share is $19). We arrive and get through security almost immediately, then go on to our gate. Late lunch: a Clif bar ($1.79). My roommate’s dad is a doctor and supplied us with all of the top sanitary essentials for our journey back to Georgia — wipes, gloves, masks, and saran wrap for our suitcase handles. On board, I watch The Notebook  for the 6o0th time and pass out. Next thing I know, I’m back in my parents living room. The first thing I do — even before giving my parents a hug hello or digging into the homemade spaghetti Bolognese I smell in the kitchen — is unload my suitcase in the laundry room to wash the New York germs out of my clothes, and take a shower. My mom had been begging me to come home for a while, sending me flights at all hours of the day before we decided to finally pull the trigger. I plan on following the current CDC guidelines, which are to monitor my symptoms and start self-quarantining — in my parents basement, which is set up like a separate apartment — at the first hint of anything iffy. I hope I'm being cautious enough. 10 p.m.  — I like to leave my phone in another room while I sleep so I don’t stay up scrolling.  I plug it in in my bathroom, and get in bed to attempt another stab at The Stand by Stephen King. Maybe now that I’m home I’ll finally finish it after all these years…Daily Total: $381.79Day Three 9:30 a.m. — I wake up to the sound of birds singing outside my window and need a minute to remember where I am. I head downstairs to find my mom making a breakfast feast: stone-ground grits, eggs, bacon, a fruit bowl, and fresh coffee — so beautiful it doesn’t seem real. Southern cooking is going to be my kryptonite again, I can already tell. I head out to the garden to eat my breakfast, close my eyes, and just sit in the silence — I can’t remember the last time I’ve heard the swooshing of trees blowing in the wind. I make a plan for the day. A long walk by the river and a meditation in the backyard should help me set my intention for the foreseeable future at home. 3 p.m. — After taking our mini golden retriever for a long walk/jog along the Chattahoochee river, I’m back on the couch trying to devise a plan for how to center and get back to the healthiest version of myself these next few weeks. I’ve been drinking far too much lately — a glass of wine with dinner is fine, but now I have the chance to drastically scale back on margaritas and espresso martinis — let’s see how it goes. 4 p.m. — I’ve signed up for the Peloton app’s free 90-day free trail, which I absolutely love. I do a 25-minute HIIT class and a 15-minute arm workout with 10-pound dumbbells I ordered from Rogue Fitness ($25). Then, I head inside for a long, much-needed jacuzzi in my parents bathtub, topped off with a charcoal face-mask from Beauty Counter ($49) and a pedicure — is this my new “Sunday scary” treatment?6 p.m. — I’m obsessed with the outdoors, and my parents have a beautiful garden in our backyard. I decide that every chance I have, I want to be out in it. So, I sit in the hammock to write down my intentions for quarantine: Take daily morning walks, drink all the water I can, eat as many plant-based meals as possible, allow my IT band to finally heal, and focus on stretching. More than anything, I want to write more, read more, and spend time with my parents. I don’t know when else I’ll get a chance to visit with them for an extended trip like this again. I help my Dad prep steak and vegetable kebabs for the grill, start a fire in the fire pit, and have that aforementioned glass of pinot noir. All free, because being home with your parents has its perks. Daily Total: $74Day Four 9 a.m. — First day working from home in Atlanta. It weirdly feels like I’m back in high school on summer break. As soon as I open my eyes, I’m craving coffee. I go downstairs and ask my parents if I can commandeer my Dad’s old office for work over the next few weeks — or maybe months. I take my breakfast (a quarter of a cantaloupe, lemon water, and coffee) in the garden and get set up reading emails. I decide I can do my job just as well from here, so I bring an extension cord out to work in the sunlight for the next few hours with a giant glass of iced lemon water. So far, so good. 1 p.m. — For my mom’s birthday last year, I sent her a Bluicer (a juicer and a blender combined into one). To no surprise, she hasn’t opened the box, so I set it up for her and show her how to combine the aging bananas in the fruit bowl, peanut butter, ice, protein powder, almond milk, and honey into an actually enjoyable protein smoothie. We have it for lunch along with some raw broccoli and red pepper hummus. My sweet neighbor across the street is going through chemo, so during my lunch break my mom and I call him up and offer to make a grocery run for him. We head out to snag some essentials for ourselves (Tylenol, eggs, paper towels, chicken, and soap), plus the groceries my neighbor needed. Luckily, my mom pays — one of those moments it's really great to be home.Once we get back to the house, I get on a call with my coworkers — they’re guessing it may be months before we get back to the office… Time to get comfortable. 6 p.m. — I leash up our mini-golden yet again and take her out for what I’ve decided is going to be our nightly walk along the river. The sky is so clear, and the air is so strong — you can smell the fresh-cut grass and the spring flowers just beginning to bloom. It’s a feeling you can’t get in Central Park, and I’ve missed it. We walk three miles along the water and I notice my leg feels a little stronger (though it might just be in my head). I get home in time to meet my Dad to light another fire in the pit. Tonight, we make pork chops and mushrooms on the grill. My mom and I make brown rice and asparagus and toss the dish in the oven for a few minutes to get crispy. Thankfully, my Dad stocked up on wine ahead of the pandemic, so we open a bottle of Freakshow, my favorite, and have dinner on the back porch. Not bad for a Monday. Daily Total: $0Day Five 8:00 a.m. — I realize there’s no point in waking up early to work out, given how much excess time I have these days. So, I decide to instead cherish the stillness and silence of the morning before my parents get up. I read The Stand for 30 minutes, and realize that maybe now is not the time for apocalyptic fiction. My parents are still asleep, so I decide to surprise them with breakfast in bed. I listen to The Daily from The New York Times as I make an egg frittata with sausage, tomato, onion, some basil from the garden, spinach, Monterrey jack and sriracha on top. And of course, coffee. I spend an hour watching the stock market plummet, then set up once again in the garden for the day’s work. 1 p.m. — I know I’m getting too much sun, but I missed the feeling of it so much, so I stay outside for another hour before heading in for another large glass of water with orange slices. My parents and extended family grow their own vegetables and pickle them, so for lunch it’s green beans and grilled pimento cheese sandwiches. Not the healthiest, but I couldn’t care less. 5 p.m. — My parents aren’t home so I head upstairs and pick up one of my guitars. Growing up, music was always my greatest passion. I remember the movements, but with no calluses left on my fingers, I’m sad to realize how long it’s been since I sat down to sing. I feel so at home and strong when I’m playing music — it’s like I’m a different person. The “musical me” is confident, joyful, and endlessly creative. I used to stay up all night in high school writing lyrics and Googling chords to make songs. The guitar is the most cathartic instrument, and I feel at peace when it’s in my hands.7 p.m. — I realize I haven’t picked up my prescriptions, so I head out to Walgreens to get my birth control ($14 copay), along with the antidepressant I’ve been putting off starting up again after being off for the last few months ($12 copay).8 p.m. —  My friend’s personal trainer has offered to give us “three on one” classes for the next few weeks at a super-discounted price ($30 per person). I set up Zoom in my basement for a bodyweight workout, which includes lots of burpees, planks, tricep dips, and bicep curls. Afterwards, I take a shower and cozy up in my robe on the couch. I convince my parents to watch The Outsider with me. We decide it’s too dark and settle on the movie A Quiet Place instead, which is actually just three times worse. Why am I craving end-of-the-world content right now?10 p.m. — My mom collects antique books, so I decide I’ll try and read a few classics while I’m home. One chapter in to Out of Africa, and I’m asleep with the lights on. Daily Total: $56Day Six 8:30 a.m. — I realize that my favorite yoga studio, CorePower Yoga, is offering online classes for free, so I’m up for a 9 a.m. for sculpt class with one of my favorite instructors. It’s raining, so I can’t do it outside, and instead set up my laptop and cushiony Lululemon mat in the carport for an hour-long class. I’m surprisingly sweaty afterwards, so I take a hot shower and fix a plate of scrambled eggs with olive oil and Everything But The Bagel seasoning. Heaven. 7 p.m. —  I leash up the dog again and head out for another long walk along the river. I realize my mom doesn’t have a plan for dinner, which is unlike her, so I offer to pick something up on my way home. She’s nervous about ordering takeout, but I assure her I will wipe down the boxes. I win the argument and pick up Thai food. Pad see ew and edamame for me and pork gyoza and pad Thai for my mom and dad. I pay, and the total comes to $48.Daily Total: $48Day Seven8:30 a.m. — I make a mixed berry, kale and spinach smoothie and set back to work trying to figure out what deadlines I have yet to meet. 12:00 p.m. — My mom enters my not-so-private office to tell me that my aunt and uncle are out of town, and they’ve offered to let us self-quarantine at their beach house in South Carolina. I feel reluctant to leave and put ourselves at risk, but she assures me we’ll stay in the house, bring our own groceries, and have a private stretch of beach to ourselves while we are there. Sounds like a dream, so I’m in, especially given the guarantee that we won’t be interacting with anyone else the whole time.8:30 p.m. — My college friends and I set a time for a Zoom conference happy hour when we were all miraculously free. Now is the time! We spend nearly two hours catching up on careers, families, boys, and cities, each with our own glass of wine. I can’t believe it took a global pandemic to get us all back together again, but it’s so comforting to laugh with them. Daily Total: $0Weekly Total: $623.12Reflection: If there was ever a time for gratitude, it’s now. In the midst of this pandemic, I acknowledge how incredibly lucky I am to have so much to fall back on: Parents who are able and willing to take me in, a regular paycheck, a healthy immune system, the list goes on. Weirdly, the time at my parents house and the general feeling of uncertainty in the air has made me more disciplined in my wellness routine.  On a larger scale, I’m hopeful that we can rise out of this downfall stronger than before. We’re all small pieces in the solution to this worldwide puzzle, and every piece in every region is crucial. I want to be able to say I fought on the right side of history in helping to flatten the curve, but with more information and new recommendations coming every day, I hope I’ve made the right choices so far. I feel I need to do everything I can to play a part in helping — even if it’s just donating to the food bank, getting groceries for a neighbor, or FaceTiming my grandfather. "

Submit your entry here!Today: A manager of a theater company whose self-care routine is built on writing, Dungeons and Dragons, and many, many cups of tea. Editor's Note: All financial information in this diary has been converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars.Age: 34Location: Vancouver, CanadaOccupation: Theater ManagerSalary:  $37,242Day One: 7:30 a.m. — Since I wake up at 6 a.m. every weekday, I have become one of those annoying people who thinks that 7:30 a.m. is a luxurious sleep-in. I tend to be in bed by 10:30 p.m. at the latest, even on weekends. Today, I stay in bed for a while to cuddle with my cat before getting up and making some tea ($2.75 for the box) for the day.I like to spend these weekend mornings without a lot on the agenda. But being productive, even a little bit, makes me feel good. I put on a podcast and slowly tidy up the apartment, get laundry going, and sip my tea. My life has just gone through a big change: My partner of four years ended our relationship and moved out. My place feels pretty empty, as I have not yet been able to replace everything. I try to let whatever feeling is happening take over in that moment, which has left me mostly feeling okay and occasionally overwhelmed with waves of sadness. Only once do I have to stop what I'm doing and cry.2 p.m. — I decide to see a play. Because of my early to bed, early to rise lifestyle, I have become a person who loves matinees. (Yes, I am basically a senior citizen, but hey, they live a pretty decent life.) I go see a play called “Jesus Freak” at a theater where I used to work. I run into a couple of friends in the lobby, including one who moved away a few years ago and happened to be back in town, which was a wonderful surprise. After the play, we linger in the lobby to catch up and unpack the show — one of my favorite things to do.It was free because I am a lucky bastard who works in theater and thus gets free tickets to most companies' shows.6 p.m. — My parents live about an hour away and they wanted to come out for a visit, so we go for dinner at one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants, the Black Lodge. It's themed after the TV show Twin Peaks, which means the decor has a super cozy Pacific Northwest vibe. Plus, the menu is all vegetarian comfort food and they have sweet cocktails. I get the poutine and a strong cocktail called the Bookhouse Boulevardier.After dinner we go back to my place to hang out a bit. Once they leave I indulge in my current comfort-Netflix show: Friends. I don't know about you, but I have found after break-ups or other grief-inducing life events, I attach myself onto some familiar, but not too complicated, show.Dinner was free because my parents paid, but it would have been about $30.Daily Total: $2.75Day Two7:30 a.m. — I wake up at my luxurious 7:30 a.m. again and brew a cup of tea before rolling out my yoga mat. I used to be a certified yoga teacher, and while the certification has undoubtedly expired, I do enjoy taking care of myself in this way now. I don't have a plan, I just start with some sun salutations and then spend about 45 minutes doing whatever feels right. Sometimes I push myself to stretch farther or hold a pose for longer, but this time it's a very indulgent yoga practice. I’m just glad to be in my body and moving, stopping to sip my tea from time to time.It feels really good to move in this way. I don't do it as often as I would like to or as I know I need. I promise myself I will do it more often.11 a.m. — A friend of mine hosted a brunch as a thank you to the contributors of his online magazine, where I occasionally write about dance. I hop on a bus ($1.59) to get to his place. He and his partner made delicious Belgian waffles and a fancy squash-egg dish. Oh, and mimosas that just kept coming. One of the top ways I feel good is by connecting and spending time with people, so it was wonderful to get together, hang out, and eat so much delicious food — even if I was a little late thanks to my bike being in the shop. 3 p.m. — Time to host my Dungeons and Dragons group! Sure, it’s dorky, but it’s so much fun. We have been getting together more or less every Sunday afternoon to play together for over a year, and this group has been a wonderful source of fun and warmth in my life over that time. I purchased tortilla chips ($3.10), hummus ($2.75) and popcorn ($1.73) for the occasion. It was a particularly eventful session where we avoided two battles thanks to incredible wits, saving our strength for the ""big bad"" at the end of our current adventure. We bested them and had a great time doing it. I felt pretty rejuvenated after they left — an afternoon with caring and imaginative friends will do that for you. I also love hosting and it felt particularly great to fill my newly-emptied home with a little extra friendship.Daily Total: $9.17Day Three6 a.m. — Every weekday morning at 6 a.m. I get up and do an hour of writing. Mostly it's for my blog, or occasionally other publications I contribute to. It's one of my favorite times of the day. Starting the day with writing makes it easier to get up, and it makes me feel grounded. Of course, I always have a cup of tea while I write.9:30 a.m. — Counseling is probably the best thing I do to try to feel good. I don't go regularly, because my benefits only cover registered psychologists, not counselors, but I made the appointment as soon as my relationship ended ($92.91). I knew it would help to have a safe space to talk about everything I was going through, and I was right. She validated my feelings and helped me process them. Today's session was incredibly useful.11 a.m. — I bought a Verilux happy light a few years ago ($76.02)  to help with my seasonal depression. I live in the Pacific Northwest, and the grey days really take a toll on me. Every cloudy day I turn on the happy light and it makes a huge difference.Daily Total: $168.93Day Four6 a.m. — Another morning writing session. This time I made Tetley green tea instead of my usual black tea. I am so relieved that the break up didn't take away my ability to do these little daily routines. In the past I have had trouble being alone with myself after a break up, and getting up early for writing time would have been too hard. For whatever reason, this time, I've been able to keep this routine and that's really made a difference.1 p.m. – It's finally sunny out! I take advantage by taking a long afternoon stroll at work, wandering in and out of the neighborhood thrift stores. I am perhaps a little too dependent on sunlight for my happiness, especially right now. But on every sunny day I try to get out there. I also love thrift shopping, and since there are a couple of shops right by my work, I like to wander through a few times a week so I don't miss something really good popping up. This way I actually take a lunch break (something I should theoretically do every day) and I get outside!5:30 p.m. — Tonight is a veg-out kind of night. I order some pizza on my way home ($10.33), curl up with my blanket and cat, and watch some more Friends. I need to give my heart a little space for healing. I am generally a pretty busy, active person, so a whole evening of downtime often leaves me feeling antsy. I know I really needed it (like tonight) so I just sink right into it for the rest of the night.Daily Total: $10.33Day Five5 p.m. — After my usual morning writing time, many cups of tea, and a full day at work, I sneak out a bit early to go to a dance show. I got free tickets through a friend to a show called Gathering Light by local Indigenous dance company. It was amazing! I convinced a good friend to also leave her work a little early and join me. She hasn't seen as much contemporary dance, so I was a little worried she might find it too weird, but she enjoyed it too.6:30 p.m. — After the dance show we strolled over to a nearby warehouse sale for Mia Melon, a company that makes raincoats that look like they belong in the city instead of the side of a cliff. In the Pacific Northwest, a good raincoat is essential, and my current one is starting to tip from looking ""well-used"" into just plain ratty. Unfortunately, I just didn't fall in love with any of the coats so I didn't buy anything. I was still really glad we went because otherwise the possibility of a really good, super-discounted raincoat would have just haunted me.9 p.m. — I finally started my gratitude journal again. I used to do it all the time and then I kind of stopped. I have a harder time keeping up with evening rituals like that when I’m in a relationship. With another person around before bed, I feel weird just sitting and writing while they are right there. I have been meaning to start it back up for a while, and now I finally did. I found an old notebook I had purchased a while ago (because you always buy new, cute notebooks when you find them on sale for $3.47) and wrote down the things I was grateful for from that day. It worked its magic. Going to bed alone is (to say the least) a downer after four years of going to bed with someone else. Spending a few moments right then to remember what's good in life doesn't make all the bad feelings disappear, but it reminds me that there is more than just the sadness.Daily Total: $3.47Day Six8 a.m. — Thursdays are my work from home day. Today, I'm a bit worried that it's not going to go well. When I'm at work, I feel some benefit of being out and around my coworkers. While the office can be a distracting place, it's also good for keeping me on task. Being all alone in my home all day with all these wallow-y emotions? Who knows. But it actually turns out okay. The middle of the day becomes a bit of a struggle, so I take a break to cook a comfort food lunch (grilled cheese sandwich) and watch a few Samantha Bee clips, which refreshes me enough to jump back in.5:30 p.m. — I meet up with a friend I haven't seen for a while for after-work donuts and tea from one of the local ""artisanal"" donut shops ($6.48). I got a classic vanilla glazed donut and a cup of herbal tea (I am trying to cut caffeine later in the day) and we got to catch up about our lives. It was wonderful to spend some one-on-one time with a pal I haven't seen for a while.7 p.m. — I am a church-going person, and one of the perks of that is regular community with people who care about your life. Every Thursday night, I have what's called a Neighborhood Group, where we get together in smaller groups in someone's home. We do a variety of things, often just hanging out, talking about our lives and things that are hard (or good), occasionally doing work to serve the community in some way. This week the plan was just to hang out and have some snacks, just what I wanted. I was done at the donut shop a bit early, and the host said I could come over whenever, so I rolled in a bit early and helped set up. I left at the end of the evening feeling that relaxed glow I get from good times with friends. As an extrovert, this is not insignificant!Daily Total: $6.48Day Seven8 a.m. — My commute is one hour whether I ride transit or ride my bike, so I almost exclusively ride my bike to work. That means I get about two hours of exercise every day, and it's worked into something I already need to be doing! Sure, I have less time to read, which is what I would be doing if I rode transit, but that also means I have less time to stare at my phone. Plus, now that it's getting brighter and warmer out, the commute has turned truly lovely. Bring on the endorphins! 7 p.m. – I tried to wash my old foam memory pillow and it just... never dried. After a week of hanging it up with heaters and fans, trying to squeeze it out, and otherwise wishing it would dry out, I figured that the center was getting a little moldy and maybe wasn't the ideal thing to sleep on. So, new pillow for me! I got a shredded memory foam bamboo pillow from Bed Bath & Beyond and it is glorious ($35.85). The one problem: It's huge; it turns out pillows have sizes. I can only use my old jersey fabric pillowcases right now because the other ones are too small.8 p.m. — I recently self-published a book, and I was able to get it stocked in a  Canadian book store chain. Today I was able to go and FIND MY BOOK THAT I WROTE IN STORES!!! It was WILD and probably one of the most exciting things I have ever done! Ironically, the book is all about how to learn to work through self-loathing and like yourself.Daily Total: $35.85Weekly Total:  $236.98Reflection: Morning writing time, tea, biking to work, and going to bed early are foundations to my wellness routine and to my life. Without those, I become a bit of an empty shell. The most positive thing I do for my wellness is be intentional about spending time with friends. The other stuff is hugely important too, but I am very extroverted and get wrapped up in my head easily. Quality time with friends is key to feeling good about myself and my place in the world."

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A librarian whose self-care routine includes reading, using a therapy app, and practicing the traditional Jewish Sabbath.Age: 29Location: Washington, D.C.Occupation: LibrarianSalary: $58,000Day One6:30 a.m. — I usually wake up early on Sundays. I settle in for a quiet morning and make myself coffee in the French press with a sprinkle of hawaij, a delicious spice blend I make at home based on a recipe from Molly Yeh’s cookbook, Molly on the Range ($23.64).While I drink my coffee, I do some journaling and read my favorite section of the New York Times: the book review. I’m a librarian, a voracious reader, and a self-proclaimed nerd, and this is one of my favorite ways to find reading recommendations. I gifted my husband a subscription last year for our anniversary, and we enjoyed it so much I renewed it this year for $5 per week. I already have the coffee and the spices on hand from my last trip to the store. 9:30 a.m. — My husband is finally awake, so we get ready to go to the farmers’ market, which is a short walk from our apartment. We drop off our compost there, and almost always run into friends. After browsing, schmoozing, and sampling, we get a ton of parsley, apples, and pears — they’re so fresh this time of year, and we like to support local farmers. We also hit up a local grocery store so we can meal prep later in the day. The haul, which we pay for with money from our shared “family” pot, comes to $45. I hit the jackpot and found a spouse who, like me, is vegetarian and loves to cook. We take our time in the kitchen when we get home, and listen to podcasts such as NPR’s Wait, Wait... Don’t Tell Me! My husband makes a delicious fragrant tagine stew with different kinds of squash, and I make couscous to go with it. I also make a big pan of baked oatmeal with apples and cinnamon. It’s delicious, healthy, and saves a lot of time in the morning when I make enough for the coming week. 10 p.m. — I get a reminder on my phone to take my medication. My doctor recommended I take my antidepressant at night instead of in the morning because it was making me sleepy. So now I just take most of my meds and supplements before bed (I try to take iron and B12 vitamins from CVS, $17.77, a few times a week). I pay for my medications through the Flexible Spending Account I get through work, which saves me money on taxes.After 10 p.m., my phone essentially turns into a pumpkin. I have it set up to automatically switch to “wind down” mode, putting the display in grayscale and the phone in do not disturb mode. I leave my phone outside the bedroom when I go to sleep, and wear an iFitness Pulse watch that acts as a vibrating alarm clock. It also tracks my sleep and steps, in varying degrees of accuracy. I got the band as a free gift through my health insurance company because I did an assessment.Daily total: $91.41Day Two6:45 a.m. — I tried to wake up earlier today, but instead overslept. I have a dermatologist appointment at 7 this morning, so I quickly get dressed, throw the breakfast and lunch I packed in my bag, and book it to their office. Luckily, it’s just a few blocks away. Thank goodness I got everything ready last night — good job, past me! I started seeing a dermatologist about a year ago, partly for some medical concerns and partly for skincare advice. I feel overwhelmed by all the beauty information and products out there, and it’s helpful to have a professional opinion. I don’t have a copay this time, so I won’t know how much the appointment costs until I get my bill — isn’t the American healthcare roulette such a fun game? On the real though, I’m incredibly privileged to have a good insurance plan, and it’s absurd that this is considered a luxury that only some people luck into.1 p.m. — Since I know the rest of the week will be fairly busy, I decide to have a quiet, not-so-sad desk lunch. If I’ve learned one thing from constantly flipping through Bon Appetit (our subscription this year is free because we were missing a bunch of issues last year), it’s that fresh herbs make everything better — especially during lunch “al desko.” I heat up my tagine in the office pantry and sprinkle it with the fresh parsley, which makes me feel fancy AF. 7 p.m. — My husband is grabbing dinner with friends from work, so that means a quiet evening watching shows that would scare the shit out of him. I slap on an Aveeno pumpkin seed face mask ($13.99), run a hot bath, and watch The Haunting of Hill House on Netflix (it’s based on a great Shirley Jackson book). Like a good millennial, I use a relative’s Netflix account. Daily Total: $13.99Day Three6:15 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm, and pour myself some coffee. Instead of immediately scrolling through my phone, I’ve been trying to just sit and enjoy my warm drink while zoning out, meditating, and easing into the morning. I get dressed, hop on my bicycle, and head to work. It’s about three miles each way, and it’s a gorgeous ride through the National Mall. I commute by bike every day, unless I know it’s going to rain. This is a free way to get in exercise and fresh air. I don’t use my phone or headphones when I bike, so I have some peace and quiet to get ready for the morning or reflect on the day.7:15 p.m. — I don’t normally do workout classes on days I bike to work, but there’s an “antigravity yoga” session tonight that I love. I book it through ClassPass. I have the “Lite” plan, which costs $15 per month. The instructor helps us use aerial silks that hang from the ceiling to stretch and do inversions. It’s a lot of fun, but I’m definitely out of practice — all the hanging upside down eventually gives me a headache and makes my tummy unhappy. I head home, take a hot shower, and drink some diet ginger ale. This is an important reminder not to push my body too hard. 10:30 p.m. — I know my husband will be up late watching political news, so I turn in and pick up the book I started earlier in the week, The Snakes by Sadie Jones. The book is free from the library because duh. I try to read in bed for 20 to 30 minutes before I go to sleep, which helps me wind down. It works like a charm, and I’m out like a light by 11 p.m.Daily Total: $15Day Four8 a.m. — When I get to work, I eat breakfast at my desk and pay my boss for our “office water club.” We voluntarily pay for access to a filtered water cooler, although there are various fountains around the office that we can use for free. I think of it as an investment in staying hydrated; plus there’s a hot water tap for when I want to have tea. This month we each owe $6.80. I’m normally the kind of person who disdains the idea of paying for something that’s usually free, but the regular water fountain tastes gross, is room temperature to lukewarm, and is much farther from my desk than the cooler.12 p.m. — Time for practice at my local choir. I love singing and have participated in various choirs consistently since high school. I think of it as self-care for my brain. My office has one that rehearses on weekdays during lunchtime, and we’re gearing up for our holiday concert. Dues are $10 for the season.5 p.m. — I meet a friend at the coffee shop Joe & the Juice after work. I haven’t seen her in a few months, and truly missed her. It feels so good to catch up over smoothies, and I insist on treating since she paid the last time we met up. The total comes to $14.80.Daily Total: $31.60Day Five6:40 a.m. — I get up between my first and second alarms and have oatmeal and coffee at home. It’s supposed to rain today, so I decide to take the bus to work. I listen to NPR’s Up First podcast, which is the exact length of my walk to the bus stop. During the ride, I spend some time on Sanvello, an app that’s billed as “on-demand help for stress, anxiety, and depression.” It’s designed around principles of cognitive behavioral therapy, and I have it set to send me a notification at a random time of day asking “How are you feeling?” I can rate my mood and get suggestions for different activities, including journaling and guided meditation. It also helps me track my “self-care” activities. While (for me) it’s not a substitute for talk therapy and medication, I’ve found it to be a helpful tool to navigate my anxiety, identify triggers, and build coping mechanisms. The app is free to download and you can pay to access all the features. My in-laws (who are retired therapists) gifted me a year’s premium subscription for my birthday.10:30 a.m. — I hit a slump during a long training at work and decide to snack on some salted nuts. I pay 16.08 a month for a deluxe subscription to the snack box company Love With Food. It’s a fun way to mix up my food options between meals, and I like that I can count on the delivery monthly. Plus, the company donates a meal to a food bank for every box you get. 12 p.m. — During lunchtime there’s a free yoga class in my office that’s led by fellow staff members. Today’s class is a great vinyasa flow, finishing off with some stretches and restorative poses. It’s a really nice break during the day, and I go back to work feeling relaxed and recharged.6 p.m. — My husband and I are hosting a dinner party tomorrow night, so tonight we have our own little cooking rendezvous. We’re planning to make Challah bread, salad, butternut squash and apple soup with red lentils, and an oven polenta with roasted mushrooms and thyme. We usually plan our menus around the contents of our produce from our Community Supported Agriculture produce share. We get it for $30 per week through our farmers’ market, but right now it’s out of season. To replace the access to produce, we get a Hungry Harvest produce box, which sends us “imperfect” or surplus fruits and veggies that can’t be sold in the store (yay less food waste!). We signed up for the “full harvest” using a friend’s promo code, which came to $18.50 for 10 different kinds of fruits and veggies. We get the rest of the ingredients we’ll need at Trader Joe’s for $36.60. After we get all the ingredients we’ll need, we take a quick break before we start meal-prepping to grab dinner. It’s perfect ramen weather, and there’s a tiny place around the corner that does an incredible vegetarian bowl. We relish the noodles and broth, and even have some leftovers. We agree that I’ll take the ramen for lunch tomorrow at work, and my husband can finish the last of the baked oatmeal we made this weekend for breakfast. It feels like I won that compromise. Dinner (and tomorrow’s lunch) with tip comes to $34.40.Daily Total: $105.58 Day Six 7:30 a.m. —  I’m at my desk enjoying my coffee with some Olyra Ancient Greek Grains Breakfast Biscuits from my snack box. It’s time for one of my favorite parts of Friday: reading this week’s Girls Night In newsletter, which offers self-care recommendations and reads for homebodies like me. I’m at work extra early so I can get home before sunset. I keep a traditional Jewish Sabbath and consider it to be an essential cornerstone of my self-care practice. Every single weekend, for 25 hours, my husband and I don’t work, drive or take public transportation, spend money, or use any technology. That might sound restrictive, but it feels much more like a retreat than an obligation. Every week, I look forward to unplugging, connecting with friends and family IRL, and checking in with myself. It feels liberating and radical to say “no thanks” to the insatiable attention economy, even just for one day.7 p.m. — Shabbat has started, and soon our apartment is full of the smell of delicious food, and the sounds of half a dozen friends. No one checks their phones (and everyone miraculously survives). We eat, talk, drink, and laugh, with the conversation spanning from campaign finance reform to The Little Mermaid Live stage show. Suddenly, we realize it’s almost midnight. After cleaning up a bit, my husband and I go to bed, feeling grateful for our community.Daily total: $0Day Seven 11 a.m. — Another benefit to keeping Shabbat? Catching up on sleep. With nothing to get up for and no phones or alarms around, it’s not uncommon for me to sleep for 12 hours Friday night, and then take an afternoon nap on Saturday. On another week, we might go to services, but we have no plans today, so we have a lazy morning of reading and chatting over breakfast.2 p.m. — We’re starting to think about buying a place, so we walk to a few different open houses, just going wherever we see a sign for one. It’s fun to look at homes that could potentially be ours someday. It’s also nice to wander without a plan or a destination, just exploring. By the time we get home it hits us that Shabbat is over in just a few hours. My husband takes a nap, and I settle into my favorite spot: a cozy chair by the window, with a blanket, my book, and a cup of tea. As the sun sets and the sky slowly changes, I finish The Snakes, and then another book. By the time I come up for air, Shabbat is over.8 p.m. — My bestie and I have a standing Saturday night date. She’s in the neighborhood already so she comes over and we catch up while raiding my fridge and watching a terrible rom-com on Netflix. Our decade-long friendship is one of the most important relationships in my life, and I’m so glad we live in the same city.Daily Total: $0Weekly Total: $257.58Reflection: As someone with anxiety, things like exercising and getting enough rest are incredibly important to me — for both physical and mental health. On my mental health journey, I’ve realized how important it is to practice self-care when you need it, not just when you feel like you “deserve” or have “earned” it. I’ve learned the hard way that if I try to postpone it until I’m less busy or have more time, I’ll just end up burning out.For me, medication, talk therapy, a strong support system, and taking time for myself is crucial to my well-being. These elements not only help keep my anxiety at bay, but they also equip me with the tools to handle stressors or panic attacks when they do happen. Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman whose wellness routine includes two gym memberships, weekly softball games, and meal prepping.Age: 25Location: Washington, D.C.Occupation: UX DesignerSalary:  $76,500Day One: 6 a.m — I wake up to my alarm and take my morning supplement, AXIO. It’s a naturally flavored powder mix of B-12 and B-6 vitamins and 100 mg of caffeine. I get a bag of the powder delivered to me monthly ($49.99) and drink it almost every morning in lieu of coffee.I get all of my belongings together for the day. I have a dermatology appointment this afternoon and a softball game at 6 p.m., so I put my glove and sneakers in a backpack. I play with my cat for a little while, feed her, and head to work.I don't know if this is a placebo effect, but these B vitamins have made me feel great! I'm always energized in the morning and I wake up for my first or second alarm instead of hitting snooze eight times like I used to. My cat and I have had a better relationship too, because now I have time in the morning for a good play sesh. 2:30 p.m. — I leave work and head to my dermatologist’s appointment. I have guttate psoriasis and recently experienced an aggressive episode that I needed oral and topical steroids to take care of. The co-pay was $30.The kind of psoriasis I have covers my entire body with little red bumps. It’s highly visible. I used to get super insecure when I was first diagnosed. Now, I don’t really care. People stare sometimes, but I can’t change that. I hate taking steroids to get rid of it, but I know that it will last for months if I don't. 7 p.m. — I head to softball. I joined a co-ed slow pitch league ($70/season) with some buddies from grad school. I played when I was younger, and I love the sport. We ended up winning our game! Surprisingly, our team is really good and we’re moving onto playoffs next week. The team we played this game has a doubleheader this evening, but they’re down a player. I decided to skip the bar with my team and sub for their second game instead. 9 p.m. — I walked the two miles home after the second game. I enjoy listening to music and walking to clear my head, especially at night. I know it’s not the safest activity for wellness, but I usually take my walks right at sundown and I know my city enough to know where not to go. Daily Total: $149.99Day Two:5:30 a.m — Early-bird gym day! I roll out of bed, throw on some gym clothes, mix up my pre-workout ($39.99 for the tub) and head to the metro. I arrive at my office and head straight to the gym, which is free for employees, contractors, and interns.Today is the first day of the next phase of the workout plan I’m currently doing, and it’s a push day. It takes me about one hour to complete all of the exercises and I add an ab circuit to the end for fun. I pay $14.99 a month for the Tone & Sculpt by Krissy Cela app, but it’s heck of a lot cheaper than a personal trainer and it keeps me up with my weights and adds additional exercises to push me. I also really like the interface. 8 a.m. — I head to my desk after the gym. The showers at my work gym are amazing. I keep a bag with back-up supplies to shower here if I feel like working out in the morning. They provide towels, blow dryers, and body soap for us. I finish getting ready and apply my topical steroid then head to my desk. On my walk to my desk I mix up my double chocolate whey protein powder ($26 per tub) and 12 ounces of almond milk to drink. 6:30 p.m. — Post-work grocery trip! I get off the metro and head to the grocery store to get dinner. I buy six ounces of salmon and arugula ($9). Dinner is good and simple tonight — I bake the salmon, put it over a cup of the arugula with some lemon juice, and heat up a side of red roasted potatoes I had in my fridge from a dinner party last weekend.8 p.m. — Tonight is night one of the Bachelorette finale. I tune in and cuddle up on my couch with some birthday cake Halo Top that was already in my freezer.Daily Total: $89.98Day Three:6 a.m — I wake up, take my measurements and progress photos, drink my supplement, and head to work. In November, my primary doctor told me I was borderline obese. I’ve always had a naturally athletic build and can carry a lot of muscle, but I gained almost 50 pounds in graduate school. I was always stressed and didn’t have an appetite for almost two years.Since I started my full-time job after graduation, I’ve been able to get back on track and focus on myself. I don’t rely on the scale to show progress, so I use measurements and photos. I take them at the beginning of each month. Luckily, I fell in love with weight lifting during my wellness journey. 6 p.m. — Workout time. I open my app to see what is on the docket for today. It’s an insane leg workout that I know I don’t want to do while the gym is crowded. I decided to hang at home for a little while before I head to the gym to beat the post work rush.7:30 p.m. — I mix together my pre-workout and walk to the gym. Along with the free gym at work, I pay for a membership at a gym near my apartment ($49.99/month). I do this because my work gym has limited equipment and my workouts are getting more intense. I made it halfway through this leg workout, then I throw up in the bathroom. I think that’s enough for me tonight. I leave the gym disappointed in myself for not finishing the workout, but then I get mad at myself for being disappointed in myself. I decide I need some human interaction. My roommate has been in Europe for a week and I really miss her. I’m friends with the bartender at my local spot and I know they’re slow today, so I’m sure he wouldn’t mind the company.  8:30 p.m. — I arrive at the bar in my gym attire and my friend, Z, is working and the bar is empty, as I had expected. I order a water and some chicken tenders. My stomach is still messed up from vomiting, but I’m ravenous so I chose something that I knew would be easy. Z and I catch up and talk about our lives. My tenders arrive and I pick the bread off like a weirdo. They do the job and I’m feeling much better. A little while later some friends of mine happen to come into the bar too, so I decide to stick around. Z gives me a PBR. He only charges me for my food ($9) so I just give him a $20 and tell him thanks.Daily Total: $69.99Day Four:11 a.m. — I walk to the work gym with a coworker. We always walk together if I go in the middle of the day, but we never workout together. She sticks to cardio machines and those are not my jam. I complete the rest of yesterday’s leg workout because mama didn’t raise no quitter. The second half of the workout consisted of deadlift variations and I love them for the sole purpose of booty gains. 1 p.m. — I finally find myself back at my desk (oops, two-hour gym break!) and heat up my lunch while I chug my protein powder and almond milk. Feeling very thankful that my managers were in a two-hour lunch meeting today, so they didn't notice my absence. 6 p.m. — I get home from work and my friend, J, comes over. I’m dyeing J’s hair for his birthday so he brings over some wine to enjoy during the process. J didn't leave until 11 p.m. I can’t believe it’s already this late. He and I get lost in conversations on a regular basis. I kind of have a crush on him, but I don’t know how to handle that part of my life. Anyway, I’m like five glasses of wine deep and I didn’t eat any dinner. I heat up a frozen Kodiak waffle and add some cherries. I hope I’m not hungover from all of this sugar. Daily Total: $0Day Five:6 a.m. — After chugging some water and my morning supplement, I find that I'm not hungover! I do my regular routine (shower, makeup, get dressed) and head to work. 11:30 a.m. — I have a phone call with my cousin, who has a masters in nutrition and recently started a wellness company.  She provides metabolic RMR testing and customized meal and fitness plans to people. I created her company’s website in exchange for her counseling services. Today was my first call with her. She thinks I might be accidentally undereating and it’s causing my body to hold onto excess fat. Yikes!6 p.m. — Since it's Friday, I'm able to go straight to the gym after work because it's not as crowded. I get in a nice upper body workout before going out for J's birthday. We end up going to our local spot. After a full night of drinking my tab is only $14, so I tip $20! ($34)Daily Total: $34Day Six:10 a.m. — I wake up a little later today and heat up the last of my protein waffles. I'm going on a date to a winery about an hour away. I'm making an effort to go on more dates. I'm not very good at being vulnerable in a ""romantic"" setting, so I'm trying to work on that. I get glammed up for the winery date, pack my overnight bag and head to the metro.2 p.m. — C picks me up from the metro and drives me out to where the winery is. He had forgotten to mention the winery was owned by his roommate’s parents and that it was a family cookout. Immediately, I go into panic mode because I'm showing up empty handed to a cookout. He assures me everything will be fine, but I was raised to bring your own booze and some kind of food to a party.3:30 p.m. — The winery is so beautiful and C's roommate and his family were very welcoming. We all did a tasting and were given the option to buy bottles if we wanted to. I get my roommate a bottle of their red blend as a welcome home gift that also doubled as a sweet sense of relief that I wasn't a total freeloader at this party ($35). C and I left around 9 p.m. and went back to his place.Daily Total: $35Day Seven:10 a.m. — Last night C and I fell asleep immediately. He's very traditional and wasn't open to having sex so early in our relationship. This led to a morning discussion about our values on a basic level. He cooked me eggs and toast while we were talking, and it was actually kind of nice. After, he dropped me off at the metro.4 p.m. — I take my pre-workout and head to the gym. I’m supposed to do a circuit at the gym today, but my legs are still very sore from Tuesday and Wednesday. I do an upper body session instead.6 p.m. — After the gym, I head straight to the grocery store to prep for the week. I buy a rotisserie chicken, broccoli, almond milk, plain Greek yogurt, almond butter — and a to-go salmon roll for dinner tonight ($32). This week’s lunch will be buffalo chicken salad with a side of broccoli and brown rice.I usually shop for food two times a week. The first is a bigger trip at Trader Joe's, which can add up to around $60. Then I'll take a mid-week trip like this one that usually totals around $30.After eating dinner, meal prepping, and cleaning it was 9 p.m. and I was ready for bed.Daily Total: $32Weekly Total: $410.96Reflection: My wellness routine is one of my top priorities. The gym and meal prepping are very important to me, but living a balanced lifestyle is way more important.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A working mother who plans ahead to make sure she finds time to fit in workouts, dog walking, and lots of caffeine. Age: 34Location: Denver, Colorado Occupation: Client services director Salary: $152,000Day One: 8:15 am. — After dropping the kids off at daycare and taking my pit bull mix out for a walk, I make a beeline to my favorite coffee place down the street. This is my daily indulgence. I couldn’t make nitro cold brew at home even if I tried, so I justify the $4.50 daily cost (plus a $1 tip). At least it’s 25 cents cheaper because I bring my own mug. I feel rejuvenated after the caffeine hits. I have an 8-month-old who still doesn’t sleep through the night, so I need this pick-me-up. I’m hoping my little one will get on a better sleeping schedule soon, and I’ll be able to do things like read for pleasure without drifting off in the middle of every page. But for now, it’s a coffee-fueled life.12 p.m. — I sneak in a workout between meetings. The perks of working from home! I run a half mile to the gym, hop on the elliptical, and do a core workout, answering a few emails between sprints. My $55 a month membership includes childcare, so I bring my 3-year-old occasionally on weekends. Today, though, I’m solo. I’ve always loved running, and right after each of my kids was born, I really missed being able to be active. I decided to commit to getting back to it when my little one was 2 months old. Plus,  my exercise sessions are often my only alone time in an entire day, so I make the most of them.4:30 p.m. — Time to take the pup for a walk. I love spending time with my dog. With two kids and a full time job, I take care to make sure I don’t neglect her.Daily Total: $60.50Day Two12 p.m. — Time for a home workout — with a few breaks to answer emails and IMs. I use the Aaptiv app for many of my exercise sessions. It’s worth the $100 annual cost. It gives me some structure, since expert trainers guide me through the moves, and it helps me continue to push myself and stay creative with my fitness. Today, I do burpees, which are unequivocally the worst. I also do lots of lunges, some squats, and Russian twists.4 p.m. — The dog and I have a great walk and on the way home she insists we stop at a pet store. She parks herself outside the shop and refuses to move her 60 pound body. I really don’t have a choice except to buy her $9 worth of treats or she’d never move. Plus, she has perfected her begging face. It’s a small price to pay for a loyal pal who gets me outside and exercising.6 p.m. — It’s really hard to cook with two needy kids at home, so I prep dinner before picking them up at daycare. I run out to the butcher shop down the street and pick up $15 worth of meat. I cook enough pork tenderloins for three meals. That way it’s off my mind for a few days and I’m not stressed about what to do for dinner.Daily Total: $124Day Three1 p.m. — One of my meetings gets cancelled, so I decide to sneak outside for a quick run. When I woke up it was nice and sunny. But the temperature dropped at least 20 degrees since then, and when I’m about a mile in, it starts misting. Even though the weather makes for a miserable five miles, I’m still glad I went out. 4:30 p.m. — I try to take a few minutes at my desk at the end of each day to look over tomorrow’s schedule, making sure I’m not double booked and seeing if there are any 30-minute breaks where I can squeeze in a workout. If I find a good slot, I’ll make that a private appointment on my work calendar; that way no one tries to schedule a last-minute meeting. My husband and I also have a shared Google Calendar where we put work trips and big events so we can make sure we don’t both commit to being out of town at the same time. Logistics are hard with a dog and two kids, but we make it work. I always feel better when things are planned out, and it’s the best way to make sure I fit in moments for self-care. 6 p.m. — Surprise! My in-laws decided to come for dinner, so I save the pork for another day. Instead, we all go out for tacos. This is a win: I get a night off from serving up food, and I have extra hands to help feed the kids. For once, I get to eat before my food gets cold. I love seeing the little ones bond with their grandparents. Being close to family is the main reason we moved to Denver. It’s fulfilling to all be together. We pay the $95 bill, because they’re taking care of the kids when I go on a work trip next week.Daily Total: $95Day Four6 a.m. — It’s insanely hard for me to commit to early morning workouts these days. I’m usually up two or three times at night with the baby. But today, I pull it together to make it to spin class at a local studio. When I think about shutting off the alarm and rolling back over, I remind myself it’s a good way to start the busy work day that’s ahead of me — and that I’ll be losing the $20 class cost if I don’t go. It feels great to sweat once I’m on my bike, and I’m super happy I made it. 3 p.m. — A few weeks ago, I purchased a teeth whitening system for $78 after seeing an Instagram ad for it, and the Colgate kit came in the mail today. It’s my first day of 10, and I’m excited to try it. With all the coffee I drink, I hope it gives me a confidence boost about my smile.4:45 p.m. — It’s been a loooong day, so I hit up a coffee shop with my dog. I relish in my afternoon $5 Yerba Mate latte, an herbal tea made with leaves from the yerba mate plant. I know the coffee thing gets pricey... but it also lets me talk to at least one other adult face-to-face during the day. I usually listen to podcasts or audiobooks while I walk the dog (unless I’m on a call for work). I just finished The Catch and Kill, which was intense and interesting. Daily Total: $103Day Five1 p.m. — I decide to whip a smoothie for myself for lunch in the Vitamix I bought a few years ago for $299.95. I throw in a scoop of Simply Tera’s whey protein powder ($33.99), plus ingredients that are already in the fridge from this week's grocery store haul: spinach, banana, unsweetened almond milk, and frozen peaches. When I have back to back meetings, it’s easier and quicker to make a nutritious smoothie than it is to whip up a full meal. Usually I drink it with a massive spoonful (or two) of peanut butter. 3 p.m. — Time to swallow some vitamins. I’m still nursing, so I’m taking Nordic Naturals Postnatal Omega 3 ($35), a Rainbow Light Prenatal One multivitamin ($17), and Nature Made Vitamin D3 ($9) every day.I’m determined to nurse until 12 months — just about four more to go. It’s a personal choice, but breastfeeding definitely takes it out of me. I have to be patted down at airport security every time I come back from a trip with a cooler full of milk. I have to coordinate pumping times with meetings, trying to work out, and all my other daily chores and activities. Plus, pumps are noisy; I almost died when my boss asked what sounded “like a metronome” when I was on a call with her (she doesn’t have kids).There isn’t much I can do to make it more glamorous, but I at least have a Willow hands-free pump ($499.99) so I’m not tethered to an outlet. The other reason I’m still pumping is because it’s special alone time with my guy. I know I’ll be sad when he stops needing me for food. I’ll often apply Aquaphor Healing Ointment ($10.30) after feeding because my little one is teething.5 p.m. — My husband’s birthday is tomorrow, and I let our 3-year-old pick out a gift, a cake (triple chocolate), and a card for him, spending $65 total. My little one likes a card with a whale on it that says “thank you.” Not exactly a birthday card, but we all do have a lot to be grateful for, so I go with it. I find it truly fulfilling to give my loved ones thoughtful presents and make sure they feel cherished. My heart is full just thinking about my husband’s face lighting up during his special day. Daily Total: $970.23Day Six 7:30 a.m. — Time to hit the gym again. I do cardio and weights at the crack of dawn because my husband is going mountain biking for his birthday and I know I’ll be alone with the kiddos the rest of the day. I’m glad I made this quiet time for myself in the morning. I stop in for another $4.50 coffee (plus a $1 tip) on my way back home.  11:20 a.m. — I have my groceries delivered. Sometimes “self-care” just means “outsourcing chores.” If you’ve ever taken two kids into a grocery store, you get it. We get about $140 worth of food, which should cover us for the next week. A few items that are always in my cart are Chobani yogurt, Cheerios, and kombucha. 6 p.m. — Time for my wonderful husband’s birthday dinner. My in-laws take us out for delicious lobster rolls, then we come home and devour the birthday cake we bought the day before. It’s always good to spend time with family. But to be honest, I wish I could get a little more alone time with him. We don’t get much kid-free time before 9 p.m., unless we can get both children to nap at the same time on weekends. We’ve been on two dates since October, but we’re currently planning a trip to make up for it.Daily Total: $145.50Day Seven 10 a.m. — My kids and I have a playdate with one of my “mom friends” and her son. We moved to town fairly recently, and I don’t have a ton of close friends here yet.  It’s nice to finally be able to have an adult conversation with another person face-to-face. Of course, the second we get to the playground, both kids have to pee. We frantically search for a bathroom, and find one in a cafe. While we’re there, we decide to pick up a coffee and bagels for $10. 3 p.m. — I treat myself to a gel mani for my work trip next week. This $40 splurge is definitely not a regular occurrence these days, but I love how put together I feel with a manicure — even though I’m in leggings and fleece that has spit up on it 99% of the time.5 p.m. — I go for a run and get to take a nice, long shower afterwards. I haven’t taken a shower that included both shampoo and conditioner in five days. Pretty gross. A lot of times, I have a kid coming in to talk to me and I have to hurry it up. So a leisurely shower is a gift. This is the most relaxed I’ve felt all week. I get to shave both legs. I even use Kate Somerville’s “ExfoliKate” scrub in the shower (I bought it about a year ago for $80 if that tells you anything about how frequently I have time to use it). My husband is watching the kids while I’m having this “me” time, which is nice. He owed me, since I’ve been doing way more than half of the childcare while he’s really busy with work.Daily Total: $130Weekly Total: $1,628.23Reflection: My wellness routine is really important to me — but not more important than taking care of my family. I’d hate to miss big moments in their lives or even morning snuggle time with the kids at this age. Because of that, it’s a real balancing act. I definitely need the leisurely Sunday showers and runs for sanity, but I try to make sure it doesn’t cut too much into time with my loved ones. To do that, I have to plan my days in advance and take any opportunities I can get to squeeze in self care. Otherwise, the days can easily fill up with everyone else’s to-dos. Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: An office manager in South Carolina who really loves the Peloton app, guided meditation, and taking time for herself.Age: 38Location: Columbia, South CarolinaOccupation: Office managerSalary:  $85,000Day One5:15 a.m. — I have a stationary Peloton bike and pay a monthly membership fee ($42), so I do a 45-minute ride. I'm not a morning person, but if I wait until later in the day, something will come up or I'll simply talk myself out of exercising.I love doing live rides. They don't always fit my schedule, though, so I mostly do the on-demand classes. Today I choose to do one of Robin Arzon's rides. She's a Peloton trainer and is super motivating; for some reason I enjoy her rides when I need to relieve some stress. Robin killed me as usual. The playlist was good, and my legs were burning by the time we were done, so I followed it with a much-needed, five-minute stretch. I feel physically tired afterwards, but mentally energized. I'm ready to face the day.7:00 a.m. — After my workout I make a smoothie for breakfast, but I'm in a rush. I opened the fridge, and the first things I saw were some blueberries. I grabbed the blueberries, half of a banana, dairy-free pea milk, three strawberries, and then I just started throwing in whatever caught my eye — chia seeds, flaxseeds, matcha, turmeric. I blended it all up, and threw it in a travel mug. I'm glad that I was able to throw together something healthy.7:00 p.m. — Time for another workout. Two workouts in one day is not normal for me, but it was stressful day, and I really need to let go of it.  I adore Yoga with Adriene on YouTube! She posts free classes online, and right now I'm working my way through her Revolution series. I'm on Day 17 which runs about 30 minutes. Afterwards, I go to my Peloton app for a five-minute guided meditation. I spend the rest of the night just winding down, and reading.Daily Total: $42Day Two5:30 a.m. — A barre studio by my home is having a grand re-opening this week, which means free classes! I was initially waitlisted for the early morning classes, but I managed to get into one a little later. I hadn't taken a barre class since moving about a year ago, and I forgot how tough it is. Driving home afterwards was difficult — my calves kept cramping up!  Other than that though, I felt great.12:30 p.m. — I'm running late after going to that barre class, so I ordered the Fuji Apple Salad with Chicken from Panera Bread. The salad itself is only $11.50 after I've modified it (I add avocado, almonds, kale, napa cabbage slaw, apple cabbage slaw and remove tomatoes, onions, and gorgonzola), but after delivery and tip, it comes out around $20. A bit much, but my office doesn't have anything nearby, and I won't get a chance to go out so there it is.6:00 p.m. — Before leaving work, I jump on my phone, and place my order with Instacart. They'll do the shopping (I hate shopping), and deliver everything right to my door. Most everything I need is under Your Items so it barely takes me any time. It's just me, and I order every few days so it's a small haul: strawberries, blueberries, bananas, celery, Wasa Crispbread, Big Easy Bucha Kombucha, and Publix Premium Blackened Talapia ($70). Not only is this a huge time saver, but it also prevents me from walking the aisles and making compulsive buying decisions.Daily Total: $90Day Three7:00 a.m. — After a rough start to the week, I made sure to prep better for breakfast today. I added some pea milk to a jar of overnight oats last night and put it in the fridge. This morning, all I had to do was chop up half an apple and add it on top. I really need to remember to have this more often for breakfast. It’s tasty, and satisfying, and it keeps me full until lunch without having any snacks. Unfortunately, I need to find a new brand. I was getting the Pantry Doctor Overnight Oats, but she's stopped making them. I knew I should have bought in bulk!12:30 p.m. — Today is my rest day, but it's gorgeous outside which is a rare thing here in June. I head outdoors for the first half of my lunch and just wander around outside. It's always nice to get away from the office for a bit, and I come back feeling so refreshed. The fresh air, and sunlight is an instant mood booster, and moving around really helps me shake off the stiffness that accompanies a desk job.  Our bodies just weren't meant to sit in front of a computer for eight (or more) hours a day.7:45 p.m. — I head to the movie theater. This is my version of #treatyoself.  I go to the local non-profit movie theater and catch a showing of the latest indie flick, The Dead Don't Die, with Bill Murray, Adam Driver, and a bunch of others. I grab a small popcorn, and a glass of hard cider from concessions before heading in. It's nice to just shut my brain off, and enjoy myself. ($20)Daily Total: $20Day Four10:00 a.m. — I was multitasking while on a conference call, and placed one of my regular Brandless orders. I love Brandless. It's the easiest way to eat organic on a budget. I order some of my staples: coconut oil, raw almonds, hazelnut spread, whole wheat pasta, pasta sauce, ketchup, quinoa, paper towels, rose facial wipes, rosewater facial toner spray, hand cream, deodorant, and even compostable coffee cups and reusable tote bags ($62). Wish I'd found them years ago!2:00 p.m. — I had an early meeting this morning (at 7:30 a.m.) so no workout, but they served breakfast. I'm too full to eat lunch, but I decided to get out of the office. I went down the road to a local kombucha shop. I grab a bottle of their Elderberry blend ($6), and spend the rest of my lunch walking around and picking out shops my mom might want to see when she visits in a few weeks.7:30 p.m. — I do a 30-minute Power Zone class on my Peloton with Matt Wilpers followed by a five-minute stretch. I love the Power Zone classes. I haven't been taking them as often as I should. I've been needing variety, so lately I've only done them once or twice a week. But I'm supposed to be doing the current Power Zone Pack challenge. For these, you're given a team and a schedule and your team gets points based on the percentage of rides completed. The teams aren't required — there's also a solo option — but you get a ton of support from your teammates and captains. I like to be told what rides to do because otherwise I sit there for half an hour not being able to decide if I want to ride to Madonna or or Guns n' Roses!I only do 30 minutes because I'm starting so late. I really should do yoga instead, so I can sleep better, but I need to burn off some energy. Afterwards I feel great, but I'm dreading getting back to my morning routine tomorrow.Daily Total: $68Day Five5:15 a.m. — I didn't seep well, and my legs (and butt) hurt! I decide to do another Yoga With Adriene video and choose one called Lower Back Love. Oh my gosh, I didn't realize how much I needed that! I follow it with a quick, five-minute meditation from the Peloton app.  Now I'm ready to face the day.9:30 a.m. — Annual check up with my dermatologist ($60). We did a head-to-toe skin check. I have a lot of freckles, and am fair skinned so I have to be vigilant.  I'm really good about using sunscreen now, but there was a time in my late teens/early 20s when I wasn't as careful. There was a spot on my back that she was concerned about so it was biopsied. I'll have to wait for the results. I'm a bit nervous since there is some history of melanoma in my family, but I won't stress about it until I hear back.8:15 p.m. — I don't typically go out on Friday nights. I'm just usually too tired after a long week. Tonight, I decide to read a book. I finished another book from earlier this week, and haven't returned it back to the library yet, so I pick something new from my bookshelf. As much as I read, I'm surprised to see how many of my Book of the Month books I still haven't read. I pick Earlier Riser because it's set in the winter, and now that it's summer time, I want to imagine somewhere cold! I love Book of the Month ($15). They send me 5 suggestions, and I can pick my favorite, skip, or add on additional selections for just $9.99 each. I've gotten at least 30 books from them over the past two years of being a member. I decide to make myself a matcha latte with matcha powder, hot water, honey, and hot milk to sip while I read.Daily Total: $75Day Six8:00 a.m. — A RockBox Kickboxing studio just opened one town over. The first class is free, so I decide to go check it out. What a fun class! I felt super uncoordinated, but still managed to get through it. I can tell already that my arms are going to be extremely sore tomorrow, but that's a good thing. The drive was further than I thought, and they mentioned opening one closer to me possibly later this year. I think I'll wait until then to try again. With limited class times, I'm not sure how often I'd be able to get there, I know even when I can, I'll talk myself out of going if the drive is too long.11:30 a.m. — I head to the farmers' market close by. I used to visit every week when I first moved here. I haven't been in a while, but I think keeping this journal has motivated me.  I normally come when they first open around 9 a.m., but I needed to shower after kickboxing so I'm a little late. I now remember why I always came early.  The parking garage was full, the avocado toast was sold out, and it's way more crowded than I'm used to. I grab lunch from one of the vendors: a shrimp po' boy, various fresh fruit and veggies, and even a small sign to hang near my back door! ($45)7:45 p.m. — I eat out most weekends just to get out a bit. I've lived here for a little over a year now, but the city still feels new to me. I usually like to try out new places, but tonight I pick a favorite of mine. There's something to be said about the ease of going to a place where you don't even need to look at the menu! I head over and grab a seat at the bar. I enjoy sitting at the bar when feeling social, otherwise I'll sit at a table and work on an itinerary for my next trip. Right now I've got a long weekend in New York City coming up at the end of the month. I order a steak for dinner, a half order each of their creamed corn and Brussels sprouts, and a half bottle of Prosecco ($75). I chat a little with the others at the bar and recommend the corn. It's so good!Daily Total: $120Day Seven7:35 a.m. — Just woke up! I love having one day where I don't set the alarm, and just wake up naturally when my body is ready. I grab my iPad so I can do another five-minute meditation from my Peloton app without even having to get out of bed. Today is going to be a great day.3:00 p.m. — This past week was a little crazy, so I've prioritized my meal prepping today so the next week goes as smoothly as possible. I also get my outfits picked out for work. I’m going to wear all dresses since it's going to be hot these next few days. I also put together a pile of workout clothes so I have no excuses. Then I head to the kitchen to start my meal prep. I boil some eggs in case I am running late (again), and the rest is really just coming up with a menu of options rather than a set schedule. I realize I'm low on a few things already so I get another Instacart order ($40) ready for delivery.Daily Total: $40Weekly Total: $455Reflection: My wellness routine is very important to me. When I'm not paying attention and not taking care of myself, I start to feel it, and as I get older, it hits faster and harder! Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman recovering from jet lag from a recent trip. She uses meditation, yoga, journaling, and other strategies to cope with her anxiety. Age: 25Location: San Francisco, CA Occupation: Product ManagerSalary: $115,000Day One: 10:30 a.m. — I wake up pretty late because I just got back from a trip to Morocco. Jet lag is setting in, so I grab some green tea ($4 at Trader Joe’s). I take my daily women’s probiotic from Garden of Life ($34), and catch up on some articles about wellness. Taking time for myself in the mornings makes me feel calm, and starts off my day on a good note. Plus, reading up on the latest trends makes me more aware of what's going on in the world.6 p.m. — Time for a deep callus treatment on my feet — glamorous, I know. A spa worker uses various ointments, salts, and oils to grind down the calluses on my heels and toes. I come out with baby-smooth tootsies. My barking dogs have endured so much from walking and hiking in unsupportive footwear during my trip. Booking the appointment was $28, and worth every penny because I really needed this. 11 p.m. — My nighttime skincare ritual begins! After my shower, I wash my face with Proactiv Renewing Cleanser ($25). I also try Merzouga Gommage, a scrub I got from Morocco, which claims to help with acne and hyperpigmentation ($20). I leave it on for 20 minutes, wash it off, and proceed with my Cocokind raspberry toner ($17), Ole Henriksen Truth Serum ($22), a Shiseido moisturizing cream (now discontinued, $70 originally), Shiseido Glow Revival Eye Treatment ($70), Glossier Balm Dot Com in coconut ($10), and jasmine Argan body oil I bought in a Moroccan market for $10. I’m basking in the moisture!! Call me excessive, but your skin is your largest organ so you need to treat it well!Daily Total: $310Day Two7:30 a.m. — I start my day blissfully with a cup of water and a 10-minute meditation. I use the Calm app (their one-year subscription plan costs $60). For the past two years, I’ve been hit or miss with my mindfulness practice, but I’m feeling ready to commit again. I’ve found focusing on my breath really helps with my anxiety — it forces me to stop thinking about work and anything else that is stressing me out at the moment. Hearing the waterfall sounds allows me to empty my mind for a few minutes and think about all that I have to be grateful for. I tend to feel overwhelmed often, so this time helps me clear out my head, at least temporarily. 3 p.m. — I took the day off work since I’m still in jet-lag mode. I take public transit to Bluestone Lane coffee shop in San Fran’s FiDi and order a matcha latte with oat milk. I use their rewards program, and they just dropped credits in my account (hooray for free stuff!). 7 p.m. — I walk to CorePower Yoga for a heated class. My sister bought me a 10-class pack recently, so this class is free. I’ve been perfecting my practice for seven years now, and I consider it the cornerstone of my mental well-being. I walk home after, feeling refreshed and zen AF. I try walking for at least an hour outside every day, whether it be to work, to the park, or wherever my feet take me.Daily Total: $60Day Three6:30 a.m. — I started my day with my 10-minute meditation, and an eight-minute morning yoga routine from a magazine article. My body is extremely stiff in the mornings — I can’t even touch my toes or do the butterfly pose correctly. I remind myself that I need to continue to stretch more in the mornings. I’ve heard it promotes digestion too. 6 p.m. — I go for a quick 3.5-mile run to Mission Creek Park. While I’m at the park, I do a quick 10-minute HIIT workout, with some push-ups, high knees, and Russian twists. This area has amazing views, so I take in the sunset and feel grateful to live in such a great place. Daily Total: $0Day Four6:30 — I put on Proactiv’s Skin Purifying Mask since I’ve been breaking out since my return from vacation. I got this for free with my Proactiv cleanser. I put on the Dear Evan Hansen soundtrack using Google Home, and do a solo karaoke and dance party as I get ready. I’m flying out to New York next week and we booked tickets to see the musical, so I’m prepping. Yes, I am that person. Listening to music honestly brings me a lot of joy, though, and it starts my day on a high note in terms of mood. 9 a.m. — It takes me about 30 minutes to walk to my office from my apartment, which is the perfect amount of time to listen to a podcast. I normally mix up which ones I listen to, but I prefer those centered around women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship. Today, I am listening to the UnStyled podcast featuring Samantha Bee. It’s comforting to hear strong females who are extremely successful in their careers — and personal lives — share that they’ve struggled along the way to get to where they are. It makes me feel less alone. 7:30 p.m. — Ugh, it was a busy day at the office. To decompress, I write in my gratitude log. I’ve been writing in a Moleskin journal ($10 on Amazon) since college, just jotting down my thoughts, ideas, and how I am currently feeling. This has helped with my anxiety, because my mind is constantly filled with thoughts that leave me feeling disoriented and distracted. It feels like a release valve when I can get them down. The pages feel personal, and they contain my feelings about break-ups, dreams, goals, and trips. Daily Total: $10Day Five6:30 a.m. — I grab breakfast with my roommates at the brunch spot near our apartment before I head to work. We are all super busy these days, so even though we live together, it’s nice to catch up and really talk it out. It's very relaxed and we enjoy just being together. I fill them in on my recent trip and show off some pictures. Quality time always gives me extra fuel and improves my mental state. I order an egg scramble with spinach, cheese, mushrooms, and chicken-apple sausage with a side of house potatoes and wheat toast. This spot gives huge portions and is definitely worth the $15. 12:30 p.m. — I sit outside in the sun to eat my lunch and take in some Vitamin D. I’ve had back-to-back meetings all morning, so just being by myself with my food is a good way to decompress. I munch on a croissant sandwich with ham from the café ($4.55), and enjoy every bite. 7 p.m. — I do my long run to the pier and find a nearby bench to work on my arms with my self-created HIIT workout. I listen to another podcast and then crank out my workout playlist, which is mostly R&B and indie pop songs; one of my favorites is Dilemma by Nelly. I walk home feeling like my mind is finally at ease after an intense work day.Daily Total: $19.55Day Six 9 a.m. — It’s continental breakfast Friday! I walk to work and the free breakfast is already set up on the counter. I plop some eggs mixed with spinach, onion, and pork sausage on my plate, and grab a few pieces of fruit. I can almost taste the weekend. 12:20 p.m. — Now I’m on the hunt for lunch. I walk outside and go to a café around the corner to order an arugula salad. Much to my disappointment, the salad was a total rip-off. I paid for a small bowl with less than ten almonds, a few slices of cheese, and one-third of a sliced pear mixed throughout. This is the price you pay (okay, it’s only $11, but still) when living in the city and attempting to eat healthy.Daily Total: $11Day Seven 9:30 a.m. — Yoga Sculpt time at Corepower Yoga! I run out of classes and purchase a five-class pack to hold me over before I head to New York ($139). Today’s instructor focuses our workout on booties and obliques. I leave the one-hour sweat sesh restored and revitalized.11 a.m. — It’s lunch time. I make myself some toast with Justin’s Almond Butter with Cinnamon ($6) for the first slice, and I use the almond butter with roasted Argan oil from Morocco ($15) for the second slice. I wash some strawberries, slice up a plum, and make some green tea ($5). Voila – lunch is served! Nut butters are my favorite source of protein, and I prefer them to eating meat. When I do spring for a burger, it often leaves me feeling sluggish and tired. Nut-based proteins, on the other hand, keep me energized and focused. I already have some of the ingredients in my pantry and fridge, luckily, but I may need to go to the store soon. 1 p.m. — My best friend comes over and we catch up. We haven’t seen each other since before my trip, so we have much to discuss. He drives us downtown and we window-shop while sharing stories. My friends and family are very important to me, so time with him is priceless.Daily Total: $165Weekly Total: $575.55Reflection: My wellness routine is vital for combating my anxiety and my overall mental well-being. It makes me the best version of myself for my friends, family, and, of course, myself. Yoga and meditation has the most positive impact, because they keep me focused. Plus, they help me avoid overthinking. Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

I'm working from home today, so I don't have to rush to catch the bus downtown. My job is a normal 9-to-5 situation but has a lot of flexibility. I'm grateful for the days that I can work from home and also for the days on which I can adjust my schedule to make time for my side hustle, volunteer work, and just life in general. Work-life balance at a job is huge for me and I would not pick a company that didn't provide that flexibility.1 p.m. — I decide that I've been working all morning and getting so much done that it's time to stretch my legs. I go down to my apartment's gym (which I can access for free because I live in the building) and run on the treadmill. Running is such a great mental activity for me. I can zone out everything else and just focus on the music or the podcast I am listening to (I choose ""Crime Junkies"" today). I sit at work most days so I think it's important to make sure I run and walk regularly throughout the day. I do 5 miles on the treadmill alternating between a jog and fast intervals. I am a sweaty mess afterwards but feel great!5 p.m. — My boyfriend and I pack up and hit the road for a two hour drive to Baltimore to attend a wedding. We stop at his parents' house and they pay for dinner. I get soup and chicken lettuce wraps and we finish the night by treating them to ice cream ($11). My boyfriend and I try to balance eating at home and going out. We usually set one night a weekend to go out to eat for dinner, but cook most of our meals at home. On Sundays, I meal prep the week's worth of breakfast and lunches I bring to work. I love going out to eat and trying new restaurants, though. Philadelphia has so many good food spots I still need to try, so I make sure to balance my healthier weekday meals with my more indulgent weekend eating.Daily Total: $11Day Two6 a.m. —  I have an early wake-up call to get to my friends house for hair and makeup for her wedding. I stop on the way to grab a cup of coffee ($1.05) and refill my gas tank. I get to my friend's parents' house to start getting ready for the wedding. The bridesmaids are drinking mimosas and in party mode, but I know for my well-being I need to refrain from alcohol until later or I won't make it through the whole wedding. I'm also going to drive the two hours back home tonight, so I won't be drinking throughout the day anyways. When I was younger the peer pressure to drink felt stronger, but now I take priority in how I feel and what is best for me.5 p.m. — The wedding is well underway and we eat dinner at the venue and dance the night away. I have never been sober at a wedding, as I usually like to party and have fun. But I know I am going to be driving home tonight and I know that I need to be up tomorrow so I make sure to stick to water and then later some coffee. The food at the wedding was typical wedding fare — good, but nothing special.Getting to spend time with my friends at the wedding was refreshing, especially since I moved away from a lot of them. I miss seeing them, so I cherish the times when we can all get together. Since moving away one year ago it has been difficult to make new friends in a brand new city (how do adults make friends?!). I have been trying to say yes to doing new things with people to branch out, even if it means taking an intimating new workout class, or getting dinner with a new friend, or texting a coworker to invite them to hangout. I have really been trying to make the effort to put myself out there to make friends in my new city.10 p.m. — We make a pit-stop halfway home and grab Chick-Fil-A ($12.50). My boyfriend is pretty buzzed and I am sober but hungry from not eating much all day. I hardly ever get fast food, but this seems like a necessary stop. We split nuggets, fries, and a milkshake. No regrets!Daily Total: $13.55Day Three9 a.m. — I wake up, chug water, make coffee, and eat a small breakfast of cashews and an apple before heading out to teach a spin class. The Sunday class is an hour long and usually it is the driving force for getting me up and moving on a Sunday. I have been teaching spin for a few months now as a side hustle, but I love that I am getting paid to not only run the class, but to workout myself. I spend an hour teaching there in the morning with some awesome riders. As an instructor, I no longer have to pay my gym fees so I save $30 a month. Plus, I earn about $150 a month teaching classes.I started to instruct because I wanted to make my own playlists and rides and fit a niche that I thought my gym was missing (it's generally an older crowd with lots of 70's music). I wanted to bring some new music and younger people to class. The added benefit of getting paid is just a bonus — I basically get paid to work out and get others to work out. 4 p.m. — Some friends come over for the football games and I make a bunch of pizzas and grab some beer and seltzers from the store ($67). I love cooking for a group of people. Not only does it save money but it's nice having everyone over rather than in a crowded bar. I let loose a little and have a few beers throughout the game. I am usually pretty hungry after teaching spin so I also have a few pieces of pizza.9 p.m. — I do my nighttime routine of brushing and flossing, wash my face with Aveeno Foam Wash ($10) and crawl into bed. I have always been an early sleeper. I'm usually in bed by 9:30 p.m. and I always try to get 8 hours of sleep. I usually read a little before bed, but this weekend was exhausting and with a few beers in me I am out like a light.Daily Total: $77Day Four7:30 a.m. — Time for the Monday grind! I am up and catch the bus to work. I bring four yogurts, four apples, some leftover salad, and some cheese sticks to work ($24). I usually bring in enough food on Monday to get me through the week. I currently have two leftover lunches from last week that I didn't eat in the work freezer. I typically do all of my food prep on Sundays, but because we were gone for most of the weekend I'm just going to wing it this week with leftovers from our dinners.On average, I spend about $100 a week on groceries. I pay for both my boyfriend and myself. When we go out to eat (about one or two times a week) my boyfriend pays.12 p.m. — I walk over to the gym which is right next door to my work and I get a quick hour long cardio/strength class in. Since my gym membership is free because I instruct there, I try and take advantage of as many classes as possible. I love the midday classes because it gets me up and moving. I also tend to skip the gym if I wait until after work to go, so this is a good way to get in a workout. The class is cardio strength training so lots of squats, jumping jacks, lunges, and push-ups so it leaves me sweaty and my muscles tired. Always a good sign.6 p.m. — I walk home from work today instead of taking the bus. Its about two miles but it's a nice enough day out today that the walk is pleasant. I walk home the majority of the time, but now that it's getting dark and colder earlier I'll probably start taking the bus home more often.Once I walk home, my boyfriend and I make dinner together. The end of our days spent catching up with each other and cooking is something I cherish. We make lean ground beef taco salads with pico, gauc, cheese, rice, and mixed greens from ingredients we already had in the fridge. So good.Daily Total: $24Day Five6 a.m. — I am up and at work early today. I do this twice a week so I can leave early (flexibility, woo!) to volunteer. I catch the bus again and eat one of the yogurts I brought into work with me.Flexibility at work is important to me because I volunteer as a coach with Girls on the Run Philadelphia. I need time to get out of work and over to the school twice a week. I have been doing this program for a year and it wouldn't be possible without the support of my company.3:30 p.m. — I walk over to the elementary school to coach. The school is a short five minute walk away from where I work, but I stop at a store on the way and grab some snacks for the girls ($6).I love being able to coach after work. It's so fun to see through the eyes of a young girl again. They are all spunky, funny, difficult, and sweet. The program involves running and character development, so I also usually get a little run in during the practice. However, I treat these days as my off days from the gym.6 p.m. — I take the bus home after coaching because I am way too tired to walk home. When I get to the house my boyfriend is searing some steaks and making roasted broccoli.My relationship is so important to me now because my previous boyfriend was terrible to me. I have prioritized what is important to me in a partner for my happiness and found the best man. He is supportive of my activities, understanding of my time commitments, and above all else happy for me. Acts like making me dinner when he knows I will be too tired to cook for myself mean the world to me.Daily Total: $6Day Six 7 a.m. — Up and at 'em for another grind at the office. I work in engineering, so some days can be mentally taxing when I work on difficult projects. My bosses are a great support system, and I truly love working there. I take the bus into work today and bundle up for the cold.I'd like to start walking to the office now that it's getting lighter out in the morning, but the warm bus is too tempting when it's cold and windy out.4:30 p.m. — I walk about ten minutes to a HIIT class I booked through ClassPass ($42 per month). The ClassPass package I have gets me about four classes per month at more ""boutique"" studios. I do the lower level of ClassPass because it is more realistic for me to go one or two classes a week, and the plan is cheaper than the membership options at my favorite studios.The class is one of my favorites — it's half done on the treadmills and half done on the floor with weights. It's exhausting, but in the best way. I love a class with pumping music, great coaches, and a good workout. Today was chest/shoulders in the weight room and I will definitely be feeling it tomorrow. I don't like lifting weights, so these classes are a great way to get me to actually do strength training.6 p.m. — I take the subway home and make dinner tonight. We grill chicken thighs from the fridge in our cast iron pan and make a salad to go with it. I always try to eat one big salad a day. If I eat a salad with mixed greens and spinach, I at least feel like I am making a big dent in my veggie goals. Chicken thighs are my favorite — way better tasting than chicken breasts — and they are usually on sale at the grocery store. One of my goals it to prioritize the quality of meat (grass fed, no antibiotics, etc.) moving forward.Daily Total: $42Day Seven 6 a.m. — Today is another coaching day, so I'm up early. I take the bus and drink the coffee at work. I eat my yogurt I brought in earlier this week, and pack an extra snack of nut butter and oatmeal to eat later in the day.I coach today and teach spin after so I make sure to bring something carb heavy that I can eat later in the day to carry me through. Oatmeal is so cheap and easy to make that it is usually a winner. I add some nut butter to it for taste and berries if I have them.3:30 p.m. — Off to coaching again! We are practicing a 5k today with the girls, so they are going to try and run and the entire thing in preparation for their end of the year race.It feels so good to see the girls finish the 5k. Most end up walking at some point, but the entire program is based on character building and the running is supplemental. Coaching is about 3 hours a week and adds to my days, but I have found it to be an amazing way to have fun and to give back to the community. The other coaches have become friends of mine, and the girls are hilarious.6:15 p.m. — I walk over to the gym I teach at and get ready for my spin class. My work, gym, and school where I volunteer are all within a few mins walk of each other to make it easy. I set up my playlist and get ready for my ride.Teaching spin has been a great addition to my routine. I love seeing people progress and it makes me feel so good to see the class having fun while exercising. I usually only teach one class a week, so I don't over-commit myself, but I sub for other instructors as needed if I have the availability. I try to balance my activities to make sure I can still enjoy each of them individually — I can always adjust as needed.Daily Total: $0Weekly Total: $173.55Reflection:My overall wellness and wellness routine is just part of my life now. I don't have an end goal, but rather want to incorporate working out, eating healthy, and having a social life into the rest of my life. I enjoy exercising and I love to cook healthy meals. I also love to spend a lazy day watching football and eating pizza, so it is all about balance in my book.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

"13","I Live in North Carolina, Make $70K a Year & Spent $599 on My Wel...","https://refinery29.com/en-us/feel-good-diary-massage-meal-prep-spinning","Welcome to Refinery29’s Feel Good Diaries, where we chronicle the physical and mental wellness routines of women today, their costs, and whether or not these self-care rituals actually make you feel good. Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes that wellness, both physical and mental, is crucial. As she copes with a long-term back injury, she’s willing to devote time and money to make sure she’s feeling balanced.Age: 30Location: Chapel Hill, North CarolinaOccupation: Fundraising managerSalary: $70,000Day One5:30 a.m. — I’m an early riser, and I’m ready for my morning workout. I foam roll for a few minutes using my roller from Amazon ($8), and then I head to yoga for a 6 a.m. class. I always leave these workouts feeling sweaty and like I achieved something. Plus, they offer lavender towels and brief neck and shoulder massages during shavasana. It’s total heaven.I buy packs of classes from the Hot Asana Studio in Durham, which usually last me a month or so. Packs run 10 sessions for $110. In my opinion, that’s crazy cheap! I moved to North Carolina from New York City a few years ago, and I’m still surprised at how inexpensive it is to live here. A pack of classes at a similar studio in Brooklyn Heights might have cost me double that.7:30 a.m. — I swallow a few of the Smarty Pants vitamin gummies I get at Costco for $16. I take collagen powder, Vitamin C supplements, and a shot of Apple Cider Vinegar, which all cost $20. I take the shot with breakfast, because doing those on an empty stomach can lead to the runs. 6:30 p.m. — After work, I spend some time on the Curable app, which helps people deal with chronic pain. I hurt my back running. The injury happened over a long period of time, because I was overusing specific muscles. The back issues can be frustrating and painful at times. This app uses mindfulness techniques to help me look at the emotional connection I have with my pain. It’s $76 for a year-long subscription, and I’ve found it’s worth every penny.Daily Total: $230Day Two5:45 a.m. — I’m up and out the door for spin class. I have a gym membership at my local wellness center that costs $56 per month. I usually only go there for the group spinning or to swim. The instructor is amazing — her classes are always full. She always plays fun music, and her motivational skills are top notch. I feel like I’m getting eight SoulCycle-level classes a month for a fraction of the price.11 a.m. — Since I eat breakfast pretty early, I have two “lunches” at work. Today I indulge in a broccoli quinoa casserole I meal-prepped this weekend. It’s a delicious Cookie and Kate recipe that has a good amount of protein and veggies in it. The meal is big enough for six servings, so I’m eating half of it this week and froze the other half for next. I live near a Trader Joe’s and picked up all the ingredients there, and it cost me $13 for everything. Not bad for six days worth of food!Cooking is usually the most relaxing part of my day. It’s almost mind-numbing. I get to focus on each element of the meal I'm preparing, instead of the world and its problems.7 p.m. — Some friends and I meet up for a monthly bike ride that was set up by a local brewery. It’s a fun way to catch up while being active. We always grab a beer and some snacks afterward. The brewery sells my favorite candy, Swedish Fish, so I get some to pair with my pale ale for $7.Daily Total: $76Day Three7 a.m. — I let myself sleep in. Essentially, I did two workouts yesterday. I make myself a smoothie using my favorite recipe. It requires blueberries, bananas, kale, Califia almond milk, and cold brew coffee (ingredients: $14.50). I make coffee using a cold brew pitcher I got for Christmas, and it comes out perfect every time with some inexpensive ground beans.2 p.m. — For my second lunch of the day, I try a Simply Protein bar I got for free at the yoga studio. I pair that with some Pirates Booty baked snacks. I buy those in bulk for $12 because they’re so seriously delicious.9 p.m. — I’m not sleepy yet since I woke up later than usual. So, I take a few hits off my Relief vape pen from Dosist. I love using this to smoke — it’s sleek and super easy to use. I’ll get one any time I go out to California to visit friends, and it costs $45. That’s a lot, but it helps me get to sleep and stay asleep until my alarm goes off. Daily Total: $71.50Day Four7 a.m. — After yoga, I make my favorite millennial meal: Avocado toast. I once heard on the Forever35 podcast that you should have a fat, carb, and protein at every meal, and this checks off all those boxes. Plus, it’s easy to make and inexpensive— $5 for a loaf of bread, $1 for avocado, and $5 for eggs from my coworker’s chickens.10 a.m. — My friend wants to meet up for coffee, so I run out to get a Starbucks latte for $4. I used to do this kind of thing more when I worked in a city, but now that I’m in an office park, it’s a real rarity for me. Breaking away from the office for a bit feels like a major treat. 5 p.m. — Once a month, I’ll get a massage after work to help with some of my back pain. The masseuse I use does a combination of Reiki and deep tissue, which has really helped me. It makes my muscles feel at ease again, and afterward I typically don't have pain from my injury for a couple weeks. He charges $40 for an hour if you pre-book, so I always have something on my calendar.Daily Total: $55Day Five6 a.m. — I almost didn’t make it to yoga this morning, but I forced myself to go so I wouldn’t lose a class credit. Afterward, I treat myself to a bougie smoothie from Clean Juice ($10). It’s Friday, after all. Most mornings I try to use the Insight Timer meditation app (free) to get my head in a good space before work. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t. But it’s the best app I’ve found. It helps me feel ready to tackle any last-minute projects. It also gives me a sense of grounding. On the mornings I don't do it, I feel like I stress out.  7 p.m. — I grab dinner with a few friends at a cute taco place. The three of us have all been single for the last year, and it’s nice for me to spend time with people who aren’t married. My main group of friends is made up of couples, and having some single girl time makes me feel more at ease about my dating situation. Tonight, we do some commiserating. Meeting a good guy is hard — it helps to vent. While I'm fine with being on my own for now, I definitely miss the comfort of having a partner. Thankfully, I’ve got good friends and jalapeño margaritas to get me through. The dinner costs $33, including tip.10 p.m. — We grab two more drinks at a bar across the street ($14). I might regret this tomorrow. Thankfully I recently bought PartySmart pills on an impulse for hangover prevention at Whole Foods ($1.50). I pop a few and hope for the best.Daily Total: $58.50Day Six 9 a.m. — I sleep in because I was out so late. Thankfully, I’m headache-free! I make my favorite southern weekend morning breakfast: Cheesy grits with an egg on top. It’s not the healthiest, but it’s so easy and gives me some comfort after a long week. I use some of my eggs from earlier in the week, and use other ingredients lying around the house ($4).2:20 p.m. — Time for a nice, relaxing swim. I’m off to my gym, which has a great heated pool for laps. I can’t run because of my injuries, so I took up swimming to get that intense cardio feeling. I do 2,400 meters once or twice a week, and it usually puts me in a good headspace. However, today, the new swimsuit I got from Amazon for $24 is definitely not working out. I notice when I’m doing a kick turn that it balloons out, and I flash everyone in the lap lanes. Oops... I’ll need to get a suit ASAP.7:30 p.m. — My friends and I have a monthly potluck. I volunteered to make something relatively easy for this one: Curried cauliflower rice. We never have enough veggies at the dinners, so I’m trying to fill in that portion of the food pyramid. The ingredients cost $7, plus $5 for a cheap wine from Trader Joe’s. Oddly, my friends and I don’t go out to eat much. Since a few of them own homes, we cook in and enjoy lounging around.Daily Total: $40Day Seven 10 a.m. — I’m pretty wiped out from the week, so I decided to do something relaxing. I go see a movie with my mom. We get to the first theater showing at 10:30, so it’s only $6 each. I get the tickets, and she gets the popcorn. We’re sweating and on the edge of our seats for most of Free Solo. I’m taking a nap after this, and hopefully won’t have nightmares about falling off a cliff. 2 p.m. — I host a monthly article club, and this time we’re meeting at a brewery. I picked up some hummus and pita chips on the way here for $5, and then buy a cheap beer for $3. I’m tempted to get another one when one of the girls busts out homemade cookies. I don’t have my hangover pills with me today, so I fill my water bottle instead.6 p.m. — Sunday means meal prep. About $40 worth of groceries is going to get me at least ten meals, some of which I’ll have during the week and some of which I’ll freeze for later. Since it’s chilly outside, I make a hearty vegetable soup and some chili. I stash a lot of my meals at work, and usually just pull something out to defrost when I’m hungry.Afterward, I light my new tiny Volupsa Lemon Coco candle ($8) and start listing out what I need to do over the next week. Doing this helps me figure out how to structure my time so that I can also hang out with my friends. That alone has become a nice form of self care for me over the years.Daily Total: $68Weekly Total: $599Reflection: My wellness routine makes me feel like I have control over my life. When I'm out of balance, I feel like I've lost some agency and can’t do the things I enjoy most. My injury plays a huge part in my wellness routine. It's something I have to keep in mind and work around, so it doesn't flare up. When it's really bothering me, I have to make sure that I take time to relax or else it only gets more irritated. Sharing a meal with friends is usually the best part of the week. It’s a sacred piece of our relationship. It's so beautiful to gather over food and talk about what's on our minds. It gives me a real sense of community. When we cook, it's like we're building something special together (sometimes that thing is tacos, and those are very special, too!).Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes in a balanced wellness approach that encompasses spiritual well-being and both physical and mental health. Age: 31Location: Smyrna, Georgia Occupation: Nonprofit MarketingSalary: $50,000Day One4:30 a.m. — I wake up super early most days to drink coffee and start my morning routine before I go to the gym. Most of the time, I read a devotional from She Reads Truth ($1.99 per month), which gives me a curated daily scripture reading plan. I try to fit in at least 10 minutes of meditation with Headspace ($7.99 per month, paid annually). I've discovered that taking 30 to 40 minutes in the morning to set my brain for the day greatly impacts my mood and productivity. Next, I head to a kickboxing class at Burn Studios. I love how strong and powerful I feel when I box, and I find myself pushing really hard on the cardio intervals today. I pay $119 per month for Burn, which has all the classes I love, great amenities, and instructors that I've started getting to know personally. Finally, I’m off to work. I call my mom on my way so we can catch up. 8:30 a.m. — I get to work and answer some emails before I eat my breakfast. I typically have oatmeal, blueberries, and peanut butter, plus a cup of green tea. This keeps me full until lunch, when I eat a faro and chickpea bowl from Hello Fresh. I'm trying meal delivery with an $80-off coupon, so I'm paying $40.66 per week for groceries right now. So far, I've been really impressed with all the meals. I try to bring my breakfast and lunch from home as often as possible.6 p.m. — When I get home, I like to unwind by reading, cooking dinner, and indulging in a little self care. I talk myself out of ordering stir fry on Uber Eats and instead make homemade ramen with tofu and broccoli. It really hits the spot, even though I know I'll feel a little bloated from the sodium tomorrow. To wind down for bed, I spend time journaling and reading a new mystery (part of the Jade Calhoun series by Deanna Chase) that I found free in the Kindle store (the Kindle was a gift from my dad). I also spend some time on the phone with a good friend who just got engaged, and I feel all the happy after I talk to her. Then I wash my face with Alba Botanica Acnedote Deep Pore Wash — I'm 31 but apparently still get zits like a teenager ($11.99). Next, I use Lush’s Eau Roma Water as a toner ($10.49 for a big bottle), followed by Tarte's Drink of H2O moisturizer, which I ordered at 30% off ($26). I take a Sprouts multivitamin every day ($7.49), then I'm in bed by 9. I make a gratitude list and read a little more before I turn the lights out at 9:30.Daily Total: $225.61Day Two5:30 a.m. — I do my morning devotion, prayers, and meditation while I drink two cups of coffee. Today is a rest day from the gym, so I take my time getting ready for work, and I put some extra effort into my makeup. I love how a good winged eyeliner makes my eyes pop behind my glasses, but I rarely feel like putting in the additional time to do it when I'm getting dressed at the gym. I head out the door and get stuck in terrible traffic behind a bad wreck. By the time I get to the other side of town for work, I'm grumpy and treat myself to some Starbucks egg white bites and a skinny vanilla latte to cheer myself up ($8.37).6:30 p.m. — Every week, I lead a women's Bible study through my church. I'm so fortunate to have a really great group of women around me. I've been able to talk through job transitions, dating, and family relationships, and it's been transformative in my spiritual growth. This week, we’re doing an interactive self help program from Andy Stanley called Address the Mess ($6.99 for the leader's study guide), and I'm already loving the discussions we have about judgement, both internal and external.Daily Total: $15.36Day Three6 a.m. — This morning I'm taking a strength and circuit training class at Burn called CrossBurn. The class alternates between strength exercises (dumbbells, kettlebells, bodyweight, and TRX), and rounds on the boxing bag. I leave sweaty, and I can tell that my legs are going to be sore tomorrow from the pistol squats.10 a.m. — I’m getting coffee with my old boss, who works in a different department now. I buy what’s basically a knockoff of Starbucks’ Medicine Ball tea ($4). At the check-out counter I notice some locally made lip balms from an artisan I've seen at the farmer's market. I'm almost out of the balm I keep at my desk, so I grab a tube ($3). My old boss and I have a great time catching up, and I show her pictures from my recent trip to Barcelona. She tells me that she's proud of how much I've grown since we worked together, and I walk the half-mile back to my office feeling uplifted.7 p.m. — I can already feel my legs falling apart from this morning's workout, so I decide to soak in the bath with a sheet mask. I love the Pacifica Beauty’s sheet masks ($4 each). This time, I smoothe on their Disobey Time Rose and Peptide mask , and bask in the glory of some lavender bubble bath I received as a gift. I read the first part of the next book in the mystery series I started this weekend, which is on sale for $3.99 on my Kindle.Daily Total: $11.99Day Four6 a.m. — It's back to Burn this morning for a spin class. I push myself really hard and get my highest power score ever! My legs are a little wobbly when I get off the bike, but I head to work feeling satisfied and accomplished.8 p.m. — At least once a week, I attend a free support group for mental health in my area. Contributions to the group are voluntary, but I try to give a few bucks every time I go ($5). The group is facilitated by a rotating group of volunteers, and we cover various topics around keeping ourselves mentally and spiritually fit, including resentment, honesty, humility, and fellowship. This group has been an integral part of my life for years, and it has truly transformed how I live on a day-to-day basis.Daily Total: $5Day Five6 a.m. — I go Burn's second location to take a spin class with one of my favorite instructors. Her playlists are infectious, with lots of early 2000s hip hop that takes me back to high school. She almost always plays ""Lose Control"" by Missy Elliott and Ciara. I push really hard again, and I think I've got to have topped my score from yesterday, but the two classes are dead even. This location just upgraded their changing rooms, so I take a few extra minutes perfecting my hair with their new Chi flat iron.6:30 p.m. — Every Friday, my best friend and I go to a Mexican restaurant by her house to catch up. This little tradition is an extremely important part of my week, and seeing my BFF isn't something I'm willing to compromise on unless it's absolutely necessary. We split a cheese dip, but my friend picks up the queso this week. I get a quesadilla and much on chips and salsa ($7.25, including a 30% tip). This week we're mired in some friend group drama, so we also run to Sweet Hut for pastries and bubble teas for TLC. I get my favorite strawberry croissant and a caramel boba tea ($8.50). We take our desserts back to her house and spend the rest of the evening chatting and catching up.Daily Total: $15.75Day Six8 a.m. — In addition to spin, circuit, and kick, Burn has yoga classes, too. This morning, one of my favorite instructors is teaching Yoga Sculpt, which involves plyometrics and weights. I drag myself out of bed at 6:30 on a Saturday to do my morning routine before class, even though I really don't want to. I'm a little drained, so I take it easy in class and lower the weights and take out the jumping. Afterwards, I run to the store to pick up a few things for breakfasts and snacks. I spend $25, including a green juice for my post-yoga breakfast.10 a.m. — I stop at European Wax Center on my way home from the grocery store for an eyebrow appointment ($25). It's been a while since my last treatment, so my eyebrows are looking rough. The technician does a great job, and we talk about some of our favorite makeup products while she works on me. I leave feeling so much better, and go ahead and make another appointment for next month on my way out.4 p.m. — I'm flying through this new mystery series, so I buy the third book on my Kindle ($4.99). For the past year or so, I've been really focused on reading books for self-improvement, but I'd forgotten how amazing it is to just get lost in a fun fiction novel. Reading has always been an escape and release for me. For the rest of the night I sit around with my page-tuner, do my laundry between chapters. I make a (delicious!) baked pasta parmesan dish from Hello Fresh. I don't have any plans tonight, so I turn in early.Daily Total: $54.99Day Seven 7 a.m. — Most Sunday mornings, I meet up with a few girls from my small group who use ClassPass for kickboxing at Burn before church. The studio owner usually teaches this class, and it's a cardio killer. We're all out of breath and covered in sweat by the end. I love starting my Sunday with exercise — it helps me feel productive and motivated for the week ahead. We all get dressed for church at the gym, then stop by Panera Bread for bagels ($5.50) before the 11 a.m. service.6 p.m. — I've been doing chores and cleaning my condo all afternoon, but I hold Sunday evenings as a sacred time. I use them to reset for the week ahead and make sure I can get off to a running start at work. I take time to journal, make a longer gratitude list than normal, take a bubble bath, and spend time away from technology. Then I pack my lunch and my gym bag for Monday, and get ready for bed. I read a little bit more, and it's lights out by 9 so that I can be well rested tomorrow. Daily Total: $5.50Weekly Total: $334.20Reflection:Prayer, meditation, and group therapy have combined to truly transform my life. On the flip side, I've realized that I'm not always the most adaptable when I get out of my routine, so I'm working on finding more flexibility in the morning and at night so that I can have a little more spontaneity in my days. Fridays with my best friend are often the highlights of my week. I love spending time connecting with someone who's so close to me — plus, chips and salsa! Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

They’re both in town to do some bridal shopping (my younger sis is getting married in 2020), but leaving today.Even though I live here in NYC, we booked one night in a hotel by Central Park just for fun. My plan is to do my long run (11 miles) in Central Park after my sisters head to the airport. I’ve only got 21 days left on my training plan for the Brooklyn Half Marathon, and I’m miraculously still on target, so I really don’t want to skip it. I brush my teeth, splash some water on my face, and get dressed in my running gear — but then we decide to do brunch near the hotel at Sarabeth’s on Central Park South. My sisters both look cute, so I decide to change. We check out, and store our bags with the hotel. ($150 for my portion, including a $35 facility fee.) When we get to the restaurant, I order coffee and the jalapeno and cheddar omelette with wheat toast. When our food arrives, I also get a taste of my little sister’s lemon & ricotta pancakes and my older sister’s chive and cream cheese scrambled eggs. All of it is so good. We split the bill evenly. $49.92 for my portion.12:30 p.m. — Annndddd... now it’s raining, so I guess the Central Park run is out.  After my sisters get in the cab to the airport, I agonize over whether I should attempt to run on the treadmill at the hotel gym (which I paid to use, included in the hotel bill). Or if I should just head home and run later. Although 11 miles on the dreadmill will be absolutely terrible, I’ll get to use the gym’s steam room and sauna afterward. Plus if I go home now, I may sit down on the couch and never find the will to get back up again. So I decide to go for it. I talk to the front desk guy who gives me a pass even though we’ve already checked out.1 p.m. — Okay, this gym is extremely nice, and it’s empty. After I change, I take a puff on my inhaler. I discovered a few years ago that the reason I hated exercise so much for so long is that I actually have exercise-induced asthma. Eventually, I made the connection that most people don’t wheeze or have coughing fits every time their heart rate goes up. I’m glad I figured it out, because working out is now really important for my mental health.I do my run in segments to break up the monotony; I tell myself re-setting the treadmill will help trick my brain. First, I do 5.7 miles (61:04), while listening to an episode of the best celebrity news podcast of all time, Who? Weekly. Then I stop for water and do another 3.3 (35:15), while listening to a Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify. Her new single “Me” is the perfect running tempo. After another quick water break, I switch to my regular no-fail running playlist for the final, brutal two miles (23:20). I have had this playlist on Spotify ($14.99 per month) for about three years now. I continually edit it, adding and subtracting songs as I go, that I use for all my races.By the end, I am drenched in sweat, red-faced, and my legs are jelly. But I feel amazing. I just did 11. fucking. miles! 3:30 p.m. — Steam room time, my reward. It’s so worth it. There is no one here so I stretch naked for a few minutes, then lay down for another 10 or so. I cool off and check out the amenities in the shower before doing the sauna next. This is going to sound weird, but I absolutely love sweating. I’m 100% sure there is no scientific basis for this statement, but I think regular heavy sweating is good for your skin. Maybe it clears it out or something? Also I think the salt is a natural exfoliant. After my shower, my skin feels super soft.7 p.m. — I wake up from a nap on my couch, and I am already super sore. Ouch. I lay on the couch for another 20 minutes before my partner gets home from work. He’s an artist, so he sets his own schedule and has spent most of the weekend in his studio working while I was with my sisters. We decide to order Mexican food on Seamless ($38.65), and while we wait for our delivery, I go to the grocery store to get us staples for lunches for the rest of the week while he cleans the kitchen. At the grocery store I buy kale, two cucumbers, four tomatoes, a bell pepper, a red onion, a loaf of 7-grain bread, a jar of salsa, a can of black beans, a bag of frozen corn,  seven large yellow parsnips, eight large carrots, five honeycrisp apples, two avocados, two lemons, and toilet paper. (Total $48.42)Daily total: $301.98Day Two7:30 a.m. — Ugh, Monday. I get up earlier than usual because last night I was too tired to do all my lunch prep. I also want to do some of the weekly chores I didn’t get around to while my sisters were here: cleaning the bathroom, vacuuming my apartment, and scooping the cat litter. A lot of people think of self-care as lighting a candle and taking a bath or some shit, but I’m a firm-believer that the best and most important form of self-care is literally just doing the unglamourous things you need to do to care for yourself. If I haven’t cleaned my apartment, it drives me nuts all week, especially because I have a cat who sheds (and poops) a lot. My boyfriend makes coffee and our regular breakfast: Bob’s Red Mill Oatmeal (which he buys in bulk on Amazon) with frozen blueberries and honey. Meanwhile, I floss with my new “dental lace” that I got at a package-free grocery in our neighborhood ($10). I’ve been trying for months to reduce the amount of plastic I use — there is so much going wrong in the world, and the giant plastic garbage dump killing our ocean is just one part of it. But it happens to be one of the things I can actually do something about, so I’m trying to be more conscious of it. The lace itself still has some plastic in it, but it’s way less than normal floss. It comes in a glass vial that you can refill, which saves a lot of plastic over time, according to the Internet.After brushing my teeth and rinsing my face, I get started on our lunches. I chop the kale, cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, red onion, and put them in separate tupperware. I rinse the beans, and microwave some corn. And then I assemble salads for both of us using all the ingredients, plus the salsa, and some home-made hummus and tortilla chips I already had. This is what we will eat every day this week for lunch. I also pack myself an apple and my portion of the oatmeal to eat at my desk when I get to work.Then, I do my other chores: I scrub down the bathroom, sweep the kitchen, scoop the cat litter, and then vacuum. Finally, I get dressed, clip my hair back in a bun, and I’m out the door by 9:15. 7 p.m. — Home from work after a stressful day. Thankfully it’s a rest day, no running! I planned to also tackle the mountain of laundry in my bathroom, but I’m too tired. I fall asleep on the couch watching episodes of Brooklyn99 on Hulu, which is free because it’s my mom’s account. Daily Total: $10Day Three 7:30 a.m. — I’m awake early again because I have to be at work early to cover a Congressional Hearing. Thankfully this morning I have fewer things to tackle. I feed my cat before again making our salads, and I realize I’m out of dressing. I’ve started making my own lately to avoid the plastic packaging. So, I whip together a recipe for Greek dressing I found online: olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, oregano, dijon mustard, and minced garlic. And then I pour it into a glass jar that once held store bought tahini. (Reuse is the most overlooked of the three Rs: Reduce, reuse, recycle.)2 p.m. — I’m on deadline at work, and hella stressed! When I get stressed from writing I get this tight feeling in my throat, like you get when you’re about to cry. I hate it, but there’s really not much I can do about it until my copy is turned in. Afterward, I do some deep-breathing and scroll Instagram to relax.6:45 p.m. — At home, I eat a snack of homemade hummus spread on a slice of 7-grain bread while looking at my running app. I use the My Run Plan App ($9.99/ month) and just do what it tells me, based on my goals. I’m a consistent and dedicated runner, but I’m not fast (and I’m fine with that). My last half I did in 2:13:17 and this time I want to try for 2:10 or better (one day I’ll break the 2-hours!). Tonight I have a 7-mile speed workout on deck. As I’m getting changed for my run, I realize most of my gear is dirty — it’s all in the mountain of laundry I neglected yesterday. Ugh. I am going on to Colombia on Friday for a wedding and a little vacation, so I really need to just do it. I decide to do my run while I do laundry. I pack all my dirty stuff into my laundry bag and lug it to the laundromat a block from my house. After I put two big loads into the wash, I run around my neighborhood — 1 easy mile and 1,000 meters of drills to warm-up, followed by 2 miles in 18:55 — ending up back at the laundromat. I pause the app to move my clothes to the dryer. Then I finish my workout — 1 (painful) mile in 8:56, followed by 10 hard 30-second repeats, and a 1-mile easy cool-down. I get my stuff out of the dryer, fold it, and head home, exhausted. 9:30 p.m. — My boyfriend is home from work when I walk in with the laundry. He’s warming up chili he made us a while ago and froze for later. I fold the laundry quickly then immediately get in the shower, where I use my shampoo bar ($18) to wash my hair. This is another recent plastic-free switch, and I love it. It lasts so much longer than a bottle does. It’s an all-natural tea tree and basil bar made by a woman-owned small business called Ava Quinn’s I found on Instagram. After a relaxing shower, I sit on the couch, and my boyfriend brings me a bowl of chili. He’s also roasting the carrots and parsnips I bought Sunday, so we can add them to the salads in the morning. We watch an episode of Shark Tank on Hulu before getting in bed. Daily Total: $27.99Day Four8:30 a.m. — Oh man, I am struggling to get up today. My right hip feels really tight. I didn’t stretch after my run, and now I’m paying for it. I vow to make it to yoga tonight. I do my normal morning skin routine: Just a rinse with water, followed by SuperGoop sunscreen ($38) and Aquaphor (which boyfriend buys in a big 14 oz. tub that I use) on my lips. I love this repairing lip balm. My boyfriend bought me these adorable glass (plastic-free!) empty lip balm containers from Amazon that I fill with Aquaphor from my bulk container. I keep one in my bedroom, one in my bag, and one on my desk at work. I’m that obsessed. Outside of Aquaphor, I don’t wear anything else. I stopped wearing makeup regularly a few years ago, after I realized it was more trouble than it’s worth for me. 7:20 p.m. — I’m still at work, pounding out my story and making a to-do list for more reporting. There is no way I’m making it to yoga. As I’m leaving, I discover someone has left mini-cupcakes in the kitchen. I eat a rainbow one and leave. As soon as I get on the elevator I regret not taking an oreo cupcake to-go.8:30 p.m. — I’m home from work. I heat up some chili, and then do more work on my story, while drinking a coffee mug full of flat champagne that’s leftover from when my sisters were here. I promise myself I will do a Youtube stretching video at least, but then boyfriend gets home from karate, and instead I hang out and talk with him while packing for my trip to Colombia. I leave Friday.Daily Total: $38Day Five8 a.m. — I’m up right on time today. Time for oatmeal, coffee, and making my salad. I have a run later, so I pack my gear so I can run along the water after work.2:30 p.m. — I’m late for my therapy appointment. I email my therapist to let her know, and she writes back “No worries. I’m here.” She’s worth every penny. ($100)6 p.m. — 5 miles easy along the water. Hudson River Park is my happy place. I love  seeing the Statue of Liberty and just staring out at the water. I read a study that found that just staring at nature patterns, like blue water or green tree tops, has a naturally calming effect on the brain. This is partly why living in a concrete jungle is so stressful— we’re hard-wired to need time to be in nature, just staring at the patterns. 8 p.m. — I finish packing for Cartagena. My boyfriend won’t be joining me for this wedding, because we’ve already been to a few this year and it’s too expensive for him right now. This one’s going to be extra challenging, because I’m not really close to anyone who’s going, outside of the bride and groom. So, I’m going to have to make friends. I’m still excited about the trip, though, because I’m turning it into a mini-vacation — just for myself. I’m also going to Australia later in the year, so I bought a new backpack to accommodate both trips. I got it on sale at the REI co-op for $89. When I’m in Cartagena for the wedding, I’m staying in a hostel to keep it affordable. After the wedding, I’m joining the bride and groom and a few other guests at a house we’ve rented. It’ll be a welcome break — and I’ll get to run in a new place, which is great for making the training fun. Daily total: $189Day Six3:24 a.m. — I’m up and on the way to JFK Airport. I’m seriously regretting booking a 6:25 a.m. flight (the round trip ticket I bought weeks ago was $554.03) while in the Lyft ($33.08). I can’t wait to pass out on the plane. Noon — I’ve made it through customs at the airport where I’m connecting to another flight. And I’m starving. Thankfully, I slept the entire first flight, so my brain is sharp enough to order a chicken empanada and a coffee in Spanish (10,000 pesos, or roughly $3) while I wait for my next flight.3:30 p.m. — Finally…. Cartagena! I find a cab immediately. I read it shouldn’t be more than 10,000 pesos, but the guy is insisting on 15,000. After one volley, I realize the extra 5,000 is not even $2 for me, so I just go with it. I end up giving him 20,000 pesos or roughly $6. 4  p.m.  — Where I’m staying in Cartagena couldn’t be more perfect. It’s right around the corner from the wedding festivities, off a beautiful square, and it’s adorable and clean. Because I know I will be staying out late both nights for the wedding festivities, I booked a private room to make it easy on myself. My room has a twin bed, and a private bathroom. It’s on the roof, with the door opening right to the rooftop bar and hot tub. I’m in heaven! I pay upfront at check-in ($65.07)7 p.m. — I have to leave the Old Town, which is basically the remnants of Spanish colonialism, contained by the fortified wall, to get to the rehearsal dinner, which is at a hotel near the beach. After I’m ready, I walk to the square to see if I can hail a cab. After about 5 minutes, I remember this is not New York. Back at the hostel, I have the front desk call me a cab. The woman who helps me is very sweet, and laughs with me when I tell her that I thought I could hail one. 7:30 p.m. — Outside of the wall, Cartagena reminds me a lot of Miami. The cab ride is less than 10 minutes. There is some confusion at the end of my ride because my Spanish is terrible and I have no idea what he’s saying. I end up just handing him two bills, and getting out when I see he’s satisfied. Only later do I realize I gave him the equivalent of $30 when the ride should have cost around $4. Oops! Daily Total: $137.15 Day Seven 9:00 a.m. — I wake up very hungover from last night’s rehearsal dinner.  How am I going to run 10 miles like this, in the middle of a heatwave?! Cartagena is known to be warm, but it’s unusually hot this week, with highs in the 90s. I refill my water bottle from the sink, and take some of the Ibuprofen I brought with me. I really don’t want to run right now, but I know that the sooner I get going, the sooner my hangover will disappear. 9:30 a.m. — This is terrible. The humidity must be 100%, because I cannot breathe. Also, my GPS isn’t working, so I have no idea how far I’m going, which is frustrating. I tell myself if I can just run for an hour, that will be enough. Based on feel I can tell I’m not running fast at all. I estimate that if I just run for an hour, I can do roughly five miles. Considering my condition, it’s a miracle I’m going at all, I tell myself. The one good thing: Cartagena is absolutely beautiful. I run along the wall overlooking the sea, then up and down the narrow streets, passing shops and churches and brightly colored villas covered in flowering vines. I run through the neighborhood Getsamani, and see the murals. If I just focus on how absolutely adorable this place is, my pain subsides — a little. I run for an hour and a half, so probably 6 or 7 miles? Good enough. Back at the hostel, I’ve just missed the included breakfast, but the front desk girl feels bad for me, (I must look red-faced and terrible) so she makes me breakfast anyway. It’s amazing: scrambled eggs, toast, juice, and coffee. Hangover is now officially cured.12:30 p.m. — After I shower and change, I have all day before the wedding festivities begin, so I venture back out to wander some more. I get an iced coffee and a pastry ($1.50) and just get lost inside the wall. I go into too many churches to count, and spend a good chunk of time learning about Cartagena’s colonial history at the Palace of The Inquisition, which is now a museum ($6). On the way back, I stop at a grocery store and buy a Sprite (I’m so thirsty) and two apples so I have snacks in my room ($3).2:30 p.m. — Hot tub time! It’s extremely hot, so I don’t even need to turn the thing on. And yet, it’s still refreshing. I text my boyfriend a selfie and a few shots of the roof view. After my trying run this morning, this is exactly what I need. 6 p.m. — Wedding time! The ceremony and the party is held on the roof of the hotel. I cry a little seeing my friend coming down the aisle at sunset. During the cocktail hour, I just drink seltzer. I have finally learned that I cannot drink during the cocktail hour at weddings; I can’t tell you how many weddings I’ve been to where I end up the drunkest person there because I drink too much during that evil open bar period. Then, by the time dinner rolls around I’m too drunk to even be hungry, and then things get really sloppy.7 p.m. — I eat the delicious vegetarian ceviche and mushroom risotto, paired with lots of red wine. Yum.10 p.m. — After dinner, I do Tequila shots with everyone at the table. Then with the bride and groom. I move on to Cuba Libres and lose count of how many I’ve had. It’s stiflingly hot up here, even with the sun down, and everyone is drenched in sweat on the dance floor. I try to drink water after each alcoholic drink, but after another round of tequila shots with a group of new friends, I just quit.Daily Total: $10.50Bonus: Morning of Day Eight 9 a.m. — Plot twist: Somehow, I’m not hungover. It’s a miracle! Especially considering I’m not sure what time I got back here last night? It turns out this is the way to avoid a hangover: avoid cocktail hour, eat dinner, and then sweat it all out on the dance floor before you sleep.Weekly total: $714.62Reflection: Making time for my family, traveling, seeing old friends, and making new ones are all just as important to my wellness routine as eating healthy, doing my workouts, and seeing my therapist. Everything I do, I do because I truly enjoy it and it makes me feel good — even running in the heat hungover — and I think that’s the key to real wellness: Do what you want when you want. Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

She wants to feel peaceful, happy, and strong — both physically and mentally. She spends time outdoors as often as possible. She says she experiences the greatest insights when she spends time observing nature.Age: 29Location: Utah Occupation: Etsy Shop Owner and Dog WalkerSalary: Varies, about $15,000Day One5:30 a.m. — The alarm goes off. Even though it’s too early, I let the buzzing wake me up. My boyfriend and I planned a rock climbing trip, and want to get an early jump on the day to beat the heat. Although we both are highly motivated by the prospect of sunrise outdoor activities, we move quite slowly getting out the door. Luckily, I had the foresight to make us grab-n-go breakfast tacos and iced coffee in a one liter Cotopaxi bottle (which was free from an event) last night. We’ve found we feel better and perform better athletically when we eat a healthy breakfast. That’s why I packed eggs and bacon wrapped in corn tortillas. To make the meal, I use eggs ($1.89), tortillas ($1.29), bacon ($2.99), Cholula hot sauce ($2.74), coffee ($9.99), and heavy whipping cream ($2.99).7 a.m. — We hike to our climbing spot. I have some severe back pain on the drive to the crag. I hike to the wall we’ll climb with my forearm crutches. I can tell my body definitely isn’t feeling tip-top this morning. I decide to tough it out.11 a.m. — Not every day you decide to tough out chronic pain is a good one. Every athlete has an off-day, and today was one of mine. One of the hardest things for me in my wellness journey has always been recognizing when I need to just turn away from something. I hate giving up on my goals, whether it’s a hike or climb. I feel like a failure when I don’t fully finish. But using my best judgment, I know it’s not a good idea for me to try this more difficult climb at my skill level. As hard as I try to push past all my mental and physical challenges today, it isn’t working. Reluctantly, I ask my boyfriend to lower me to the ground, and we pack up our gear. My boyfriend says he is proud of what I accomplished. I don’t understand. I didn’t finish my climb. However, he knows how hard it is for me to acknowledge my limitations, and he’s proud of me for climbing smart and playing it safe. Acknowledging my vulnerability is a strength, he says.Daily Total: $21.89Day Two7 a.m. — Although I often reach for my phone as soon as I wake up to check messages, update social, or go over my to-do list, I refrain this morning. At least once a week, I try to allow myself a morning to lie still and enjoy being lazy. It’s even better for me mentally if the morning I allow myself to be lazy isn’t planned. I’m not a very spontaneous person, but I’ve tried to get better at it. It feels good to listen to my body, read the moment, and do something that wasn’t officially scheduled.11 a.m. — My boyfriend and I go to the gym. I have a VASA Fitness membership, for which I pay $10.59 per month. To be honest, I don’t get much satisfaction out of gym workouts. I’ve always preferred getting  my activity in outside. However, I’ve realized recently that I need to up my training game for the sake of my athletic pursuits.11 a.m. — I cycle through several upper body exercises, targeting the muscles that will assist me in rock climbing. Then comes the dreaded leg workout. My undiagnosed condition that has affected my mobility has caused me a lot of nerve issues. While I’m grateful I can still use my crutches for short distances, I rely on my wheelchair to get most things done. I have better function in certain leg muscles than others, and my boyfriend has been working with me on isolating and strengthening those muscles to give me better ability and endurance when I climb. It’s difficult to stick with it when you can’t see visible progress day to day, but I tell myself that it will pay off in time.7 p.m. — I make dinner at home. To be budget-smart, I pick up some steak on final sale ($4.40), two green peppers ($1.58 each), and some sour cream ($2.29) at the store. At home we already have an onion, corn tortillas, and homemade taco seasoning. I throw together some simple (and tasty!) fajitas. It always makes me feel good when my loved ones enjoy the things I make.Daily Total: $18.86Day Three1 p.m. — I run some errands. After I stop at the post office to mail a completed order from my Etsy store, I head to the grocery store. I top up on a few items I’ll need for the next few days, and spend about $19.72.The process of budgeting groceries and executing the plan of that budget is satisfying, but the shopping can be challenging for me. I had an eating disorder for several years and the grocery store can provoke anxiety. However, when I get home, and prep food, it helps keep things in perspective.5:30 p.m. — I’m winding down for the night, and decide to take out my forearm trainer ($7.95). It’s a round, rubber, donut-shaped device made by Black Diamond. I didn’t climb today so this will be great for some targeted exercises. The device has helped me increase my grip and finger strength for climbing, which is important because one of the things my disability caused was diminished hand function. I go through several reps while enjoying The Office on Netflix (subscription $8.99 per month).Daily Total: $16.94Day Four6:30 a.m. — It’s another early morning of rock climbing. Yesterday, my boyfriend scouted a zone with a crack he thought I would enjoy scaling. Upon attempting it, I find it’s still outside of my skill set. I feel discouraged and frustrated. I want to figure it out and not give up, but I just don’t have the experience yet.I move to another part of the crag and attempt something a little simpler. I lead climb this route and finally feel some success. It is such an incredible feeling. I love having him join me at the top of the climb. It feels like a very special closeness with him. I feel pride in myself, and in him for all the work we’ve put in to get to this moment together.Daily Total: $0Day Five5:45 a.m. — I’m meeting my boyfriend’s family in the mountains for a two-day camping trip. We wake up early so we can go climbing at a new area on the way. I’m eager to get out the door, and my patience is wearing thin. I know I need to continuously work harder to be more flexible and spontaneous in life, but this morning I’m not finding that balance. My boyfriend does something very rare for us these days: He pays for breakfast at Burger King. Potatoes are one of my comfort foods, and he knows it. The crispy brown bites, combined with an iced coffee, bring my spirits up before rock-climbing.8 p.m. — We’ve been at the campsite on the mountain for about four hours now. We decide to start a campfire as the temperatures begin to drop. Everything about a campfire is soothing to my soul: The challenge getting it started, the smell of the smoke, the crackling sound, the warmth when there’s a chill in the air. I get lost staring into the flame, watching it like it’s a living thing. I feel at peace.Daily Total: $0Day Six 7:30 a.m. — I love waking up in a tent. I always feel so lazy, though, because it’s so cozy. I don’t want to get up. Once I finally get my day started, I visit with my boyfriend’s family while waiting on our eggs and bacon to cook up. I attempt to make some coffee over the morning campfire coals and fail miserably. I decide to just make a small pot with the Jetboil coffee press ($11.26) because I’m getting desperate. The day doesn’t start for me until I have a cup of coffee. It’s not about the caffeine as much as the ritual. It’s comforting.1 p.m. — On our way to Bryce Canyon National Park for our family activity, I get some really terrible news about my home business. I want to immediately leave the trip and go deal with the issue. My boyfriend tries to help me realize that I can’t change anything today. We came all this way to spend time with his family, but now I feel like I can’t be present. We drive into the park. I have an America the Beautiful Access Pass for the National Parks. It’s a free lifetime pass for citizens with a permanent disability that allows me to get our entire carpool vehicle in for no charge (saving us $35). Most of the family decides to go on a short hike that would be tricky for me, particularly in the midday heat. My boyfriend and I decide to hang out in the shade and enjoy the scenic overlooks.6:30 p.m. — My boyfriend’s stepbrother expressed interest in rock climbing, so we take a detour to a nearby zone with some good established routes. The road to get there is very rough. It causes me a lot of pain because we’re bouncing up and down. It’s worth it when we get there, though. There’s a challenging yet fun scramble to get to the wall. I am able to help my boyfriend’s stepbrother and instruct him a little. It’s always fun to share a passion you have with others and watch them enjoy it too.Daily Total: $11.26Day Seven 7:30 a.m. — Lazily, we pack up our camping gear. The rest of the family is camping another night, but we have to get back to work. We have a relaxing morning with a successful pot of percolator coffee (it’s sooo satisfying!) and a delicious egg scramble, then head home.2 p.m. — I’ve been out of reliable cell range for two days, so when I get home, I talk on the phone with a friend who I haven’t spoken with for a while. I confide in him about the bad news I received on Thursday. He has no solutions, but does offer comfort. I feel a bit better. I’m motivated by his words, and take some small forward steps to make sure the news I received doesn’t have a long-lasting impact. I tend to withdraw from people when things get hard. I’m glad I have stubborn friends who know to keep bugging me when they don’t hear from me for a while. There really is nothing like a strong community of family and friends when you’re having a hard time.Daily Total: $0Weekly Total: $68.95Reflection: The best part of my week was climbing on Wednesday morning. Wellness is important to me, but overall I try to stay away from a specific ""routine."" My disability can cause my life to vary and change, and I have to be in tune with my body to know when I need to rest and when I can push. I used to be afraid to do anything for fear of pain or making things worse. But, eventually, I got sick of missing out. I just expect now that everything will cause me pain, even doing nothing. So, I’d much rather do something fun or interesting with my time.Without a diagnosis I’ve learned to pay close attention to my body. How it reacts to activity, temperature, certain movements, and even tightness of clothes in certain spots. My mobility and pain levels are variable day to day. Without warning, I could have a major flare up during rock climbing. Sometimes I can adapt and deal with it, but sometimes I have to stop and have someone lower me to the ground. Managing my disability for me is simply listening to and responding to my body in the moment.I choose to focus on how to manage my disability, rather than on why it’s happening. Eventually, the doctors might have answers for me, but for years, the stress of tests and appointments showing no results negatively impacted my health. I was getting no management from my medical team because they didn’t have a diagnosis. I felt alone. That’s why I had to take matters into my own hands if I wanted to have any quality of life in my twenties. I didn’t want to miss out waiting for answers that may never come, or may not come for years.Edited by Kelly Dawson, a disability advocate who was born with cerebral palsy and has a master's degree in media communications.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

"17","I Live in Ottawa, Make $48K a Year & Spent $378.73 on My Wellness...","https://refinery29.com/en-us/wellness-routine-bodycombat-and-fitbit","Welcome to Refinery29’s Feel Good Diaries, where we chronicle the physical and mental wellness routines of women today, their costs, and whether or not these self-care rituals actually make you feel good. Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who is revamping her approach to wellness. She’s adjusting to a desk job, after a crazy grad school schedule. She tries to focus now on living a balanced life, while being mindful about activity, food, and her approach to downtime. As someone engaged in public policy, she considers the environmental impacts of her actions, and sometimes that weighs heavily on her mindset. This is why she tries to make sustainable choices.Age: 25Location: Ottawa, CanadaOccupation: Policy Analyst Salary: $48,000Day One11:30 a.m. — Last week was a busy one, and I didn't get to the gym as much as I would have liked. So, I definitely need some activity in my life today. I meant to get up in time for a BodyCombat class I love at my gym, but I was exhausted and slept straight through my alarm. I’m on my own for a self-directed workout. Today, I do arms and core for about 25 minutes, then another 25 on the elliptical, while listening to yesterday's episode of the podcast Call Your Girlfriend. I get a great gym discount through work, so it costs me roughly $28 per month.1:30 p.m. — It’s time for grocery shopping and meal prep. I have Celiac disease, and work hard to live below my means most of the time, which means I meal prep my work lunches for the week. This week I'm doing a chickpea curry with spinach, peppers, and onion, and making a quinoa, pepper, tomato, and chickpea salad for dinners on nights I’m feeling to lazy to cook. I also buy supplies for oatmeal breakfast cookies. I already have the oatmeal and spices, so I pick up bananas and eggs. I also grab cucumbers, cheese, hummus, navel oranges, oat milk, pasta, and regular milk for my morning coffee. This all adds up to $48.79. 7 p.m. — This last week was jammed with social activities, so, as an introvert, I need some R&R. My roommate is out tonight, so I take advantage of having the apartment to myself. I spend some time catching up on TV. I watch Jane the Virgin and The Handmaid's Tale. Then I read a bit of the book I'm working on, From the Corner of the Oval by Beck Dorey-Stein, before heading to bed around midnight. I borrowed the book from the library, and I share my streaming subscription with my mother, and end up paying $8.38.Daily Total: $85.17Day Two10:30 a.m. — I decide to take advantage and spend as much time outside as possible today. I retrieve my bike from my building's storage room and ride along the Rideau Canal to a small farmer's market. It's about a 20 minute ride each way at a moderate pace. It's lovely to just bike past all the people out for walks, runs, and kayaking trips on the waterway.2 p.m. — I’m still feeling that introverted vibe, so I decide to relax on the couch, read some more of my book, and catch up on my finances from last week. I try to do this every week, and keep a massive spreadsheet in my Google Account to track and categorize all my spending and saving. I'm a bit of a data nerd — I also wear a FitBit (I got it for $137.19 on sale) and track my sleep and workout habits pretty religiously. This helps me feel more in control and better informed about how much money I have.6 p.m. — I've been going to a studio for weekly yoga classes for about a year now. Although my gym offers yoga, I go to a studio. I love the teaching style and the option to take warm or hot classes. I buy 25 class packs at Costco every 6 months or so for $152. It works out to about $7 a class, but my mum bought this pack for me as a gift. I bought my yoga mat last year from Lolë, and the fabric is both recyclable and PVC-free, so it's a more sustainable option than some of the alternatives out there. Tonight is a warm yin class, which is exactly what I need after yesterday's weight session. It’s an awesome way to end a relaxing weekend, while resetting for a week of work ahead.Daily Total: $137.19Day Three5:30 a.m. — I make it to my BodyCombat class tonight to make up for skipping on Saturday. This is a beast of a workout. It’s a high-energy mashup of different martial art styles. I always leave sore and soaked in sweat. Today is an especially tough class — very lower body focused. I leave totally red-faced and gulping back water, but I feel amazing (if exhausted).7 p.m. — I wouldn't usually consider going out to dinner a feat of self-care, but my boyfriend’s parents are in town. This week is the first time I’ve met them. I was initially incredibly anxious about it, so the fact that they keep inviting me to join them in activities is helping to assuage my nerves. We go to a fantastic wine bar that does cheap and delicious steak. I know they'll insist on paying, but I grab a Groupon to cover some of our wine flights. I end up covering $15 of the alcohol.Daily total: $15Day Four7:15 a.m. — I overslept. Does that count as self care? Clearly I was exhausted because I slept straight through both my FitBit alarms (luckily I also have a late alarm set on my phone). I pour a quick (reusable) mug of coffee, and make it out the door almost on time. I walk to work every morning and usually listen to podcasts on my way in (today it's the Bechdel Cast).10:30 a.m. — I meet with a student who wants to learn more about the work my team does. Getting a job in government is hard, and I've been really lucky to have a good support system along the way. I'm excited to have a chance to do the same for someone in the same place I was only two years ago. She's lovely, and I try to give her as much advice as possible. She tries to pay for our teas, but I know how much students are paid. I overrule her and pay the $2.70 for both of us.4:30 p.m. — I decide to just go to the yoga class at my gym today so I can get home from work sooner. It’s high intensity, and focuses on core. I sneak out of work a few minutes early to get there on time (although I didn't really take a lunch, so shrug). I settle in for an hour of a combination of tai chi, yoga, and pilates. The classes at my gym have a corporate feel, which is why I usually prefer the other classes. I miss the more intimate feel of my usual studio. Still, it’s a good way to get loose after last night’s class.Daily Total: $2.70Day Five9:30 a.m. — I grew up playing hockey, but chose to coach younger kids instead of playing myself in undergrad. I recently decided to finally get back to the game myself. A while back, I signed up for a women's league, which requires a paid deposit. I got paid today, so I take some time this morning to send $115 off to the woman who's organizing our team.12:15 p.m. — I've gained some weight over the last year, which I believe is a combination of moving to a desk job and getting an IUD put in. As such, I've been trying to be more systematic about my approach to fitness. To get more active, I'm playing in an outdoor mixed sports league this summer. I’ve been looking for the perfect pair of shorts to wear while I play. On my lunch, I see that the Gap has some great deals right now, and I can't resist. I order a pair of dolphin-hem run shorts, and cross my fingers they'll fit like the Old Navy ones I currently love. I also order a pair of casual shorts and deeply discounted shirts to hit my free shipping minimums. My total is $50.54, but only $16.50 is spent on activewear. I know how bad online ordering is for the environment, but my local stores have a terrible in-store selection.5:30 p.m. — I planned to go to a weight-lifting class after work, but I've had an awful headache and upset stomach all afternoon. I decide to accept my fate and have a quiet night at home. I roast some vegetables, and dump some pesto on top, then head to bed for some TV and reading before I fall asleep.Daily Total: $131.50Day Six 8:10 a.m. — I normally make my coffee in the morning, but I woke up feeling pretty “meh” today. It takes longer than usual to get out of bed, so I save about 8 minutes by buying my coffee on my way in to work. It's convenient (and dangerous for my wallet) that I have a great local chain right behind my apartment building. I grab my reusable mug, so at least I'm not generating more trash with my laziness. The coffee is $1.72. 5:45 p.m. — My boyfriend and I play in a mixed sports league with our friends. We usually do different sports during different seasons, and this week it's flag football. It's a ton of fun, a great group of people, and guarantees some outdoor time and cardio sessions every week. One of our teammates just got an adorable puppy, which makes the league that much more fun. We pay to play $83 to play at the beginning of the season, but it works out to about $5.45 per week. Lightning starts up toward the end of the game so we call it early — but we still win.Daily Total: $7.17Day Seven 12 p..m. — I'm almost done with From the Corner of the Oval, so I take my lunch outside and sit in the grass along the river and read. I eat my prepared quinoa, chickpea, avocado, and tahini salad. There's a great breeze, so it doesn't matter that it's a little humid today. I make it through a good chunk of the book.5:30 p.m. — Since I skipped my weight lifting class on Wednesday, I force myself to go tonight. It's the Friday before a long weekend, so I'd love to just start relaxing — but I know this class is a good way to start the weekend right. It's a super tough workout (for me) that I rarely go to, but I know I'll feel great about it later.7 p.m. — I almost never buy flowers for myself, but a friend gave me a coupon she had for a free bouquet. It expires on Sunday, so I go slightly out of my way to pick out a bouquet to enjoy all weekend long. The arrangement includes tulips and other flowers. I know it'll make me happy every time I look at it.Daily Total: $0Weekly Total: $378.73Reflection: I've been trying to prioritize my wellness routine more. I want to make it a regular part of my schedule, so I can’t opt out of it for things I’d rather do or have to do. Being active regularly has the biggest positive impact on my life. My mood is much better when I focus on wellness a little each day. It quells some of my physical anxieties, and I sleep better.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

"18","I Live in New York, Make $58.5K a Year & Spent $918.26 on My Well...","https://refinery29.com/en-us/wellness-routine-masturbation-marathon-training","Welcome to Refinery29’s Feel Good Diaries, where we chronicle the physical and mental wellness routines of women today, their costs, and whether or not these self-care rituals actually make you feel good. Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes in a haphazard approach to wellness. She once had a personal trainer who told her: ""It's not good to have too many goals."" She can't seem to follow his advice.  She reads a lot about wellness trends, and often sets spur-of-the-moment goals, which she says she sometimes abandons weeks later for another new idea. This leads to an unconventional mix of marathon, weight, and HIIT training. But doing a little bit of something each day is better than nothing. Age: 24Location: New York, New YorkOccupation: CopywriterSalary: $58,500Day One8:15 — I drag myself out of bed, after snoozing four phone alarms, as well as my Phillips Somneo Sleep and Wake-up Light, which jogs me out of sleep by lighting up my room with artificial sunlight while blasting an orchestra of chirping birds. This fancy-ass clock makes waking up slightly less painful. Although I love being awake, there is nothing I hate more than getting up in the morning. The alarm clock runs $179.95, but I tested it for a previous job and got to keep it, so it was free. I put on mascara and a dress, floss, brush my teeth, and am out the door in under 15 minutes. I take the subway to work, and listen to my favorite podcast, Reply All, a free Gimlet Media podcast. I find the stories they tell to be thoughtful and inspiring, and it helps me mentally prep for a long Monday at work.9:15 — I start my work day by drinking our office’s in-house coffee with oat milk. I answer emails while dipping a honeycrisp apple into my jar of Justin’s coconut almond butter, which is my current obsession. I eat it on everything: Apples, rice cakes, spoons. It’s about $12 for a jar, but this jar was a gift. My mom sent the apple home in my suitcase the last time I visited her. She’s a doll.7 p.m. — My best friend and I meet up after work for a quick bout of retail therapy. I buy a dress for my birthday trip this weekend from Banana Republic for $89. As we shop, we vent about our boy probs. Honestly, she’s a better therapist than even retail! Next, we head to Trader Joe’s to pick up a few things for the week. I buy avocados, lemons, chicken, and red licorice. I only spend $25 because I already have some less perishable items in my fridge from my last TJ trip. My friend and I hug and part ways. When I get home, my roommate and I go out for a quick three-mile run through the neighborhood. As we trot down our street, we catch up on our weekends, since we were both out of town. When we get home, I shower, and grill up some lemon garlic chicken. It will be dinner and tomorrow’s lunch. It’s boring, but I don’t have time for extravagant meal prepping in my life at this point. At 11, I settle in my bed for the night, watching half an episode of Mad Men on my laptop while eating my chicken and licorice. It’s been a busy Monday, but it’s for the best — I don’t do well sitting still.Daily Total: $114Day Two5:30 a.m. — I have a busy day, so I get up early to prepare. I pop a Sakara Life probiotic. I also take a Frunutta vitamin D pill, and a MyTrition Energy multivitamin. Like almost everything else in my life, I’m sporadic about taking my vitamins. I am skeptical that anything but the probiotic is actually working for me. Once, a friend told me that New Yorkers don’t get enough vitamin D, because they’re in their offices working and not out in the sun. I know The New York Times says that most people aren’t actually D deficient, but I still take the vitamin because I like to bask in the placebo effect. I actually got most of these vitamins at my old job, so they were free. The probiotics are left over from a Sakara Life meal plan I tried. I fill up my water bottle, which I will chug on the subway to work. I drink loads of water — it’s really the only constant in my wellness routine. I feel sluggish and get headaches when dehydrated, so it’s a must-have for me.6:30 p.m. — I meet up with two friends and my roommate for happy hour at a bar downtown. I get a glass of pinot noir and then nurse a glass of whiskey on the rocks as we spend the night catching up on our lives. It’s about $28 for both drinks, including tip. I prioritize hanging with friends and family over most things. I find it’s important for my mental health to spend as much time with positive people as possible. I’ve been known to drop everything for my friends, which has both perks and drawbacks.11 p.m. — When I get home, it’s time for bed. I try to balance reading before bed with watching Netflix. I often feel overwhelmed by everything in the world that needs to be consumed. There’s always a new must-watch show or best-selling book everyone is talking about. Before bed, I try to keep up with the Joneses — but in a fulfilling and relaxing way. If something is popular, but I find it draining or boring, I’ll skip it (Breaking Bad was too stressful for me, for example). I only have an hour or so before bed to read and watch for fun, so I might as well enjoy it. Tonight, I read a chapter of I Miss You When I Blink by Mary Laura Philpott, which I borrowed from the library.Daily Total: $28Day Three12 p.m. — Today, I’m working from home. I don’t wear a bra for most of the day, which is as “self-care” as it gets, in my opinion. For lunch, I have a Trader Joe's Quinoa Cowboy veggie burger ($3.69) with no bun that’s smeared with smashed avocado. I also heat up a bowl of frozen cherries ($3.50) in the microwave — a poor woman’s cherry pie. It’s more appetizing than it sounds. I drink some Aveda tea, which is delicious and calming. It’s also expensive at $20 for 20 tea bags. I drop a Nuun tablet ($24 for four sleeves) in my water for extra electrolytes to rehydrate from last night.6:30 p.m. — My best friend and I go to an event at a hotel. We drink lavender chamomile tea with milk and honey, and chat with other guests. Then we go up to a hotel room and make essential oil room sprays. I make my spritz with the scents lavender and frankincense, which our host says have meditative and relaxing properties. Next, we do yoga nidra, which is basically a fancy way to say guided meditation. Our teacher tells us to bring our awareness to our toes, fingers, and belly button. I feel like I’m riding into a land of relaxation on a cloud — until guests chatting loudly out in the hall pull my focus. It’s a bit frustrating, but I try not to sweat it. My friend has a hookup, so the event is free.9 p.m. — I head to the gym. I was supposed to do a workout class this morning at 7:30, but I canceled last minute because I couldn’t drag myself out of bed. This is a constant problem in my life, and I have no idea how to pull my brain out of its incessant quest for “ten more minutes” of rest. Although I skipped the morning workout, I still “fit it in.” I go to Equinox (my membership is $175 a month) and do a Kayla Itsines BBG workout through the Sweat app ($120 for annual membership). I can feel your skeptical looks — yes, I pay for an app on top of an expensive gym. If it seems extra, it is. But I’m a person who has a hard time getting myself to do strength workouts. The nice gym environment and structured workouts in the app help me stay more consistent. It’s leg day today, and the BBG Stronger plan has me doing angled leg presses, squats, lunges, and burpees. I run two miles before leaving the gym feeling accomplished, but exhausted.Daily Total: $346.19Day Four7 p.m. — When I get home from work, and my roommate isn’t around. I take this opportunity to self-indulge using my Blueberry Bliss California Exotics Waterproof Turbo Glider vibrator. I bought it in college for $10.32, and it always does the trick. I use the Dipsea app, which offers a variety of different erotic audio stories tailored to women. It’s basically a porn podcast. It really doesn’t get any more millennial than that, folks. It’s $47.99 for a year’s subscription. I find “me” time is an important part of self-care (and literal self-love, ha!), and helps me release stress.7:20 p.m. — I always choose sleep over making a proper meal in the morning, so I like to make nice breakfasts for dinner. Tonight I make avocado toast. I smash up an avocado in a bowl with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic salt, and Trader Joe’s Everything But The Bagel seasoning, which costs $1.99, if you buy it in-store. I smash it on toasted rye bread and pop two poached eggs on top. I add more seasoning because I’m obsessed with that stuff.8:30 p.m. — I go to Equinox and do another BBG workout. Tonight it’s arms and abs-focused. I have the upper body strength of a kitten — a fact I’m trying to change. I don’t want to get too muscle-y, but I would like to get to a point in my life where I can open a jar of pickles on my own. With that in mind, I do tricep push-downs and extensions, mountain climbers, sit-ups, and bent-leg jackknifes. I leave feeling a little restless after leaving the gym, so I go for a walk and talk to my mom on the phone. She always makes me laugh and feel less anxious.Daily Total: $60.30Day Five1:30 p.m. — I’m usually an even-keeled person, but sometimes when I get overwhelmed with emails and work, I need to take a quick minute to calm myself and focus on my breathing. I step into a conference room and use an app called PranayamaFree. It literally just uses two chimes to tell you to inhale and exhale deeply over and over again. It’s simple, soothing, and, obviously, free.8:30 p.m. — I have a date with a guy I’ve been seeing casually for a few months. We go to my favorite wine bar on the Upper West Side, and I drink a glass of pinot noir. I usually find dating to be exhausting, but this guy doesn’t make it feel like a chore. We keep it light and have similar tastes in wines and politicians, so that’s something. I’m not convinced he’s “the one,” but he’ll do for now. He pays, so the wine is free. 11:55 — I’m finally home, and it’s time to shower and do my nightly skincare routine. First, I do a replenishing Joanna Vargas Eden Instant Face Mask, which sits for 20 minutes as I catch up on The Bachelorette in my bed. I have tried various brands of skincare throughout the years, but have found that Neutrogena cleanser and Oxy Pads are the only products that keep my face clear and zit-free. I know they’re a little harsh on my skin, so I try to make up for that at night with Clinique ID Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion, Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer, Olay calming mist, and retinol from ZO Skin Health by Zein Obagi. I got most of these products for free from my old job, but the Oxy Pads are $5 at the drugstore.Daily Total: $5Day Six1:30 p.m. — It’s my birthday weekend, so I go to a beach resort with my besties. As soon as we arrive at the resort, we make mixed drinks in the hotel room. I mix some rum my friend brought, with pineapple-flavored Vita Coco Coconut Water, which I picked up at a convenience store for $1.88. We jump and dance on the beds to the song “New Romantics” by Taylor Swift. It’s going to be a good weekend. The hotel for the night is about $400, but my parents got it for me for my birthday.2:30 p.m. — I put on $8 Hawaiian Tropic body SPF and Lancôme’s face sunscreen from their $40 Aqua Radiance Set, and head to the beach. My friends and I pull three reclining beach chairs up to the water’s edge. We read books, bask in the sun, and talk about who we’ll vote for in the 2020 election. Later, we go for a walk down the coast line, and do cartwheels in the sand.9 p.m. — We grab dinner at the resort, and split a bottle of red wine. I have the shrimp scampi for dinner, which tastes so fresh. The conversation is scintillating, and accompanied by a cabaret singer playing '80s rock hits. My roommate buys my dinner for my birthday — she’s the best. While we’re at dinner, some local boys come up and ask us to meet them at a nearby bar. After dinner, we split an Uber there for $6.30 each. When we get there, a guy buys me a few drinks, and I enjoy free whiskey on the rocks all night. My friends and I all dance together like we’re still in college, and we scream when the DJ plays our “thank u, next” request.Daily Total: $54.30Day Seven11 a.m. — After dancing all night, we sleep in. I pack my bags, and then buy a Starbucks iced coffee with almond milk, which is $4 with tip. My friends and I take our coffees to the beach and debrief. We talk for hours in the big blue lounge chairs. We joke around, and reflect on what our mid-twenties will bring. We giggle and watch the waves roll in until we have to head back to the city.6:30 p.m. — I pop into Trader Joe’s after I get home. I pick up two “Field Fresh” chopped salads with grilled chicken, and some mango chips. My total comes to $11.47. I eat the salad and some of the chips for dinner while people watching on my front stoop with my best friend.8 p.m. — I run seven miles, and then apply $40 Cause + Medic Hemp Pain Cream to my knees and calves to head off soreness. I should foam roll, but I’m too tired. I’m allegedly training for a marathon. I did a program through the New York Road Runners last year that allowed me to quality for the 2019 TCS New York City Marathon. Registration for the historic race costs $255, on top of what I paid last year for the qualifying races — and they say running is a cheap sport. Marathoning originally seemed like a great idea, but now I’m nervous. I still have some time to prepare, but I haven’t exactly kept on track with my training plan. Between BBG, fitness classes at Equinox, and running, it’s clear that I’m a little bogged down with goals. But I’ve found life is more interesting when you aim high. The beauty usually isn’t in achieving the goals themselves, but the journey getting there.Daily Total: $310.47Weekly Total: $918.26Reflection: My approach to wellness is a bit sporadic. Sometimes I’ll feel like marathon training, sometimes I won’t. I switch up my skincare routine constantly. I’ll go to the gym consistently for a few weeks, then I’ll skip it for a while. I wake up and go to sleep at odd times. It’s not a normal life, but it’s the one I’m living. It’s well intentioned, and I’m generally healthy. The number one constant is my friends. They’re what feeds my mental health the most, and the ones I prioritize above it all. I wouldn’t trade them for the world.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman whose relationship to wellness is informed by a past history of struggling with eating disorders. As such, she tries to approach health with grace. She says wellness is an important part of her daily life, but she doesn’t put pressure on herself to follow a specific routine. She tries to be intuitive and do what feels best for her body and mind at any given moment.Age: 27Location: Richmond, Virginia Occupation: Environmental ConsultantSalary: $55,000Day One7:30 a.m. — The one constant piece of my morning routine is a cup (or two) of coffee. It's less about the caffeine boost and more about the ritual of slowing down and enjoying a cup before my day starts. I sometimes brew coffee in a French press, but I’ve recently switched over to iced. Anything hot sounds gross right now because of the humid weather. I recently tested out iced coffee concentrate from Lidl ($7.99), which turned out to be really tasty. Today, I make it in my favorite Healthy Human tumbler ($22.99), which comes with a metal straw. This keeps it cold, and it’s good for the environment — score! There is no us without an Earth, so I try my best to limit my impact where I can. I try to incorporate reusable items into my routine, recycle, and purchase products that don't use environmentally harmful chemicals. I'm not perfect at this, but I strive to be better.8 a.m. — In the past, I wrote in a gratitude journal every morning before work, but I’ve gotten out of that habit. In an effort to do it more often, I bought a sparkly Spiderman journal from a craft store for $4 that makes me smile every time I use it. As part of my journal, I pick a card from a deck I bought for $11 called Affirmators! 50 Cards to Help You Help Yourself - Without the Self-Helpy-Ness! These cards help me set an intention for my day. Today, I pull the “self love” card. We could all use more of that. I definitely notice an overall difference in my attitude when I journal in the mornings. I head to work feeling good.6 p.m. — Our apartment gym is pretty bare bones, but nice. It's convenient to be able to walk two minutes and get a workout in. I warm up on the treadmill and then complete a sweaty 20-minute Tabata circuit. I use the free Interval Timer — HIIT Workouts app to keep track of each Tabata round. I used to have a complicated relationship with exercise, but now it’s a way for me to feel strong and manage stress. After a lot of practice, I’m much better at listening to my body and only working out in ways that make me feel good.Daily Total: $39.99Day Two8:30 a.m. — My daily commute is about 30 minutes each way. To keep myself from going crazy, I listen to a lot of podcasts. I am currently loving Armchair Expert with Dax Sheppard. Hearing celebrities talk candidly about their struggles is oddly comforting to me. It makes me feel like we’re all humans dealing with crazy emotions. We’re all just trying to make the best of our messy lives.2 p.m. — After lunch is the hardest part of the day for me. My job is extremely desk-based, and afternoon slump tends to hit me hard. Today I decide to take a quick 10-minute walk. I come back to my desk feeling refreshed. I decide I need to make this part of my daily schedule. Nature is really the best medicine, and it's free!6 p.m. — I signed up for ClassPass (my package is $29 per month) a few months ago, and I love it. Tonight, I decide to take a class at my favorite hip-hop dance studio. Dancing is one of my favorite ways to exercise since it feels more like a party than a workout. The community at this studio is awesome. After my contemporary-style class, the owner convinces me to stay and take a new class they're offering. Halfway through the second class, I realize that this was overly ambitious. I return home sore and exhausted.Daily Total: $29Day Three12 p.m. — I usually pack my lunch, but I treat myself by going out once a week. Today I’m craving the modern Greek salad from Panera ($12). I add smoked chicken and have a baguette as my side.7 p.m. — The two dance classes last night have me feeling so sore. It's obvious that my body is crying out for some rest, so I happily oblige. I take the night off from exercise. I decide that a face mask sounds nice, and put on my favorite chlorophyll mask, which is $19 from Cocokind. It's dark green, and my husband tells me I look like the Hulk. Rude. We snuggle on the couch with our dog as we watch a 2002 action film with Christian Bale on Netflix called Equilibrium. We love over-the-top action movies like this. It’s a perfect night.Daily Total: $31Day Four6 a.m. — My body is still feeling a little tender from the dance marathon (lesson learned), but I’m craving some movement. I sign up for a hot yoga class through my ClassPass account. I hope it will help loosen me up. The workout ends up being just what I need. I’m a sweaty, noodle-y mess afterwards.5 p.m. — Tonight, my husband offers to cook Korean food for us. He makes spicy chicken thighs using gochujang (Korean pepper paste), while I pickle some cucumbers. We eat it wrapped in lettuce with rice and more gochujang on top. All together, the ingredients cost about $20. When I was struggling with my eating disorder, I needed to control every little thing I ate, so I never let others cook for me. Today, I’m so grateful to be healed, and to be able to share moments like this with my husband.6:30 p.m. — Most Thursdays, I get together with a group of friends for drinks. We try to do different things each week. We hit up trivia nights, breweries, food truck rodeos, and concerts. I consider myself an introverted extrovert, so I enjoy having a mix of social and non-social nights throughout the week. After a few nights in, I’m excited to see my friends. My hubby joins too! We go to a taproom where you pour your own beer, paying by the ounce. It allows you to try different brews without committing to a full pour. The weather is great, so we sit at a table outside and chat until almost 9 p.m. We leave feeling grateful for our friendships and cheap beer — our bill was only $22 for the both of us.Daily Total: $42Day Five7 a.m. — Now that I am in my late twenties, I’m more conscious about taking care of my skin than I used to be. I don't have an extensive skincare routine, but I have a couple of things I use every day. If nothing else, I always use a face moisturizer with SPF. Since my skin is not particularly sensitive, I'm not too picky about the brand. Currently, I am using the Shiseido Benefiance WrinkleResist24 Day Cream SPF 18. It's typically $60, but I received my bottle for free as a gift from my mother-in-law. I slather it on my face, neck, and ears. I feel moisturized and protected. I use the Cocokind mymatcha stick ($8.99) to help reduce the appearance of my dark circles under my eyes. I also rub it on my lips. It’s a multi-functional staple of mine.6 p.m. — Instead of going to the gym to exercise, I decide to take my dog — an adopted border collie mix — for a long walk. She loves walks, and enjoys being out in nature as much as I do. I throw on my favorite Plantronics BackBeat Fit Bluetooth Headphones ($80), and listen to music on Spotify while we walk along the river. It's so nice to be outside after a long day in the office. I zone out as we cover four miles. Although I haven't mastered quiet meditation, I feel like walking in nature clears my mind and helps me relax in a similar way.Daily Total: $88.99Day Six 9:30 a.m. — It's the weekend, so we sleep in. I slowly enjoy my coffee on the couch. After taking the dog out, I head to our apartment gym for a quick workout. I decide to play around with some equipment I don't typically use. I incorporate the battle ropes and TRX bands into my circuit. It's fun to switch things up. I leave the gym feeling energized after my 30-minute sweat session.11:30 a.m. — A friend invites us to hang out at his apartment's pool, so we throw on our bathing suits and head over. It's over 90 degrees outside, so this feels like the perfect activity. We pick up a case of Corona Refrescas ($19) to enjoy poolside. I’m obsessed with the coconut lime flavor — it’s become my drink of the summer. I enjoy two while lounging and reading Origin by Dan Brown on my Kindle.7:30 p.m. — My husband and I typically dine out at restaurants a few nights a week. Tonight we meet some friends at our favorite Chinese place. We share the dumplings for an appetizer, and I order the tofu and veggie stir-fry as my entree. The portions here are huge, and it's one of the few places that we actually leave with leftovers. Our bill ends up being about $50. I cover it, since my hubby paid for groceries this week. We're all still having a great time after dinner, so we decide to walk over to a nearby brewery to continue the night. Hubby pays for our beers, and we stay out for a few more hours chatting and playing ping pong. I crash into bed at midnight and sleep hard.Daily Total: $69Day Seven 6 a.m. — Despite the late night, I'm up early to drive to North Carolina to visit my parents. It's Father's Day and my Dad's birthday, so my brother and sister are also in town. We have a BBQ, play corn hole, and enjoy cake. I spend most of the day laughing. It’s so good to be surrounded by family. I make the drive back to Richmond feeling loved and recharged. Time with family and loved ones is priceless, and great for my mental health.7:30 p.m. — My husband and I have a shared love for puzzle games. I’m not typically interested in the computer games he plays, but we recently found an app we can play together. I make us popcorn from kernels on the stove top ($3) and we snack on it while playing The Room ($.99) on his phone. We have a blast solving creepy puzzles for a couple of hours before heading to bed.Daily Total: $3.99

Weekly Total: $309.96Reflection: Wellness impacts how I show up to life. If I’m not taking care of myself, it negatively affects my work and relationships. This week, I was able to spend a lot of quality time with friends and family, while still having time alone to recharge. I'm not always great at balancing these things, but I'm getting better. Having more grace and flexibility in my wellness routine has been really positive. I no longer set stringent expectations or rules for what I have to do to be “well.” Instead, I take it day by day. I try to respect what my body needs.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes happiness has more to do with your body than your mind. She thinks fitness is not just about looking better; it's about feeling better too. She feels self-care isn't as simple as a trip to the spa.Age: 23Location: New York, New York Occupation: Marketing & Communications CoordinatorSalary: $75,000Day One: 5:30 a.m. — I go to Duane Reade to pick up a fruit bowl for breakfast and a mango Vitamin Water for my spin class. This costs $10. 6 a.m. — An early morning cycle really helps me start my day. I feel spent and energized at the same time. I just started spinning at Swerve, after hearing about it from a friend. It’s a competitive atmosphere — you have to compete against yourself, and other riders. My goal is always to ride harder than last class, and earn a higher Swerve score. It's a healthy kind of competition that motivates you to ride your best, even in the dark, when no one is watching. Because I travel for work unexpectedly, I like to purchase the package of eight rides for $248. 7 a.m. — A nice, cold smoothie helps me recover from my workout and get going before work. I get a large power shake from Joe & The Juice, which has strawberry, banana, and vanilla milk in it. These usually cost about $8, but, because I just downloaded the company’s app, this one is $5.Daily Total: $263Day Two6 a.m. — I grab another power shake from Joe & The Juice for $8. I sip on it while catching up on emails. It really hits the spot. Taking the time to enjoy the shake before my morning workout gives me some time to wake up before I hit my bike for SoulCycle. Next, I head to Starbucks where I order a tall, blonde roast coffee for $2.95. I sip on it as I walk to spin.7 a.m. — Time to snap my feet into my bike at SoulCycle. I love going to their classes when I want a high-energy cardio workout. These classes can be pretty pricey, so I only go once in a while. I got a deal, so this one is $25.  I love that my instructor brings an upbeat vibe to the room. His playlists are usually inspired by his everyday life. During my last ride with him, we rode to some music he heard while traveling in the Caribbean. He makes the class interesting and fun.10 p.m. —  I believe nighttime is the best time to moisturize, so I go all out. Kiehl's avocado eye cream is the balm (pun intended), and it’s $48 a pot. I'm in the mood to relax with an under eye treatment, so I slap on two of Peter Thomas Roth Hydra-Gel Eye Patches, which are $75. I’m still on the search for the perfect moisturizer, but I'm currently loving Philosophy's Hope in a Jar overnight moisturizer, which is $69. Daily Total: $227.95Day Three6:30 a.m. — I like to make coffee at home with my Keurig ($125) most days for the sake of saving some money. A pack of 100 K-cups usually costs $30 on Amazon, and ships free with my Amazon Prime membership. This morning I sip on some plain black coffee, and I turn on the news to see what's going on in the world. I've always taken my coffee black; this is a habit that I picked up from my dad. I might experiment with seasonal flavors, like pumpkin spice in the fall, but I always come back to black.7 a.m. — I have a fitness center in my apartment building. I hit it up, and try to get some cardio in. Cardio is a stress-reliever for me. I always go for at least 45 minutes on either the treadmill, elliptical, or stair climber. Then I do 15 to 20 minutes of weight lifting or abs exercises like crunches. Luckily, I’m into music that’s good on the go: G-Eazy, Drake and, Jay-Z are all favorites.8:30 a.m. — I like to start work nice and early, despite the fact that most of my coworkers start at 9 or 10. This gives me the down time I need to start my day, catch up on emails, and prioritize my work. I like feeling caught up and ahead of the game, because I know I won't be stressed out later if I get derailed by more pressing tasks. When you plan ahead, there's less room for setbacks. Being prepared makes me feel calmer about life and work.Daily Total: $155Day Four7 a.m. — Time for some self-guided yoga. I invested in my own mat, and I do yoga at home most of the time. I love my Manduka yoga mat because it’s thick, which is great for people like me who are sensitive to putting pressure on their joints. It works miracles for my wrists and knees. My mat is a few years old, and was about $150. Not only is yoga super relaxing, it's great for loosening up those tight muscles in your back.9 a.m. — Vitamin time! I’ve been using Care/of, which sends me monthly packs of personalized supplements. These pills address all of my health concerns, and come in convenient packs that I can take with me to work without carrying a pill case around. The first time you order, it's $40.5 p.m. — Time to gear up again for cardio and circuit training. I do about 45 minutes on the elliptical and 20 minutes of circuit training. It’s my go-to workout. I love spending this time getting my heart rate up and clearing my head. For me, it’s about toning up, and I especially like to do ab and arm workouts. I did two workouts today because Thursdays can be high-stress and deadline-filled for me. I feel more calm when I start my day yoga and then clear my head with cardio after a long work day.Daily Total: $190Day Five6 p.m. — I take some time to knit a hat. I love my hobby, because there’s a certain accomplished feeling to make things from scratch with your hands. It’s also a great stress-reliever. I tell anyone who will listen to adopt a hobby and invest in it. It can take such a weight off your shoulders, and help you unwind, in my experience. The supplies to knit the hat cost $50. 7 p.m. — Time to finish off a relaxing evening with some reading. Right now, I’m devouring Michelle Obama's memoir, Becoming. I don't get enough down time to read, so when I do, I really appreciate the peace and quiet. I think the perfect compliment to a book is a cup of chamomile tea. I bought the book for $20. Daily Total: $70Day Six10 a.m. — What will I do this morning? Nothing. That's right. Nothing! There's no better feeling than sleeping in on a Saturday morning and waking up to have nothing to do. I strongly believe that everyone needs a day off, not just from work, but even from “work” that happens at home, For example, chores and obligations. At least once a week, I refrain from cooking, cleaning, or doing laundry. I just do nothing. It’s so soothing.12 p.m. — I love Bravo TV shows, but can never watch them when they air. So, I like to binge watch my shows on the weekends. The Real Housewives, Below Deck, Vanderpump Rules, and Dirty John are some of my favorites. There’s nothing better than vegging out on the couch and catching up with your favorite characters.Daily Total: $0Day Seven10 a.m. — Sunday Brunch isn’t just about bottomless mimosas and french toast for me. In order to maintain a healthy social life, I make time to meet up with friends and try a new restaurant a few times a month. Today, we go to The Crooked Knife and order an omelet. Keeping up with friends makes me feel relaxed. As we chow down, we chat about our blogs and the best skincare products we've tried lately. In total, my bill comes to $455 p.m. — I love a clean apartment, and feel more productive and relaxed when everything is in its place. Call me crazy, but I believe a clean apartment leads to a cleansed and happy mind. I know, it’s very “Danny Tanner.” But this Sunday ritual helps me prep for the week. My cleaning products of choice, Scrubbing Bubbles and lemon-scented Clorox Wipes, cost $25. Daily Total: $70 Weekly Total: $975.95Reflection: My wellness routine is everything to me. I'm a strong believer in self-care. If I don't take care of myself first, I can't do my job or help others — it’s the old airplane mask tactic.Most of my wellness routine focuses on fitness because I care a lot about maintaining my appearance. This is something that I'm trying to let go of because I know it’s important to be happy with my body and feel comfortable in my own skin. About a year ago, I decided that my fitness routine was about more than just “looking good” — I also want to feel good.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes in a simple yet effective wellness approach. Her three must-haves? Tons of food, nature, and Barry’s Bootcamp.Age: 28Location: Los Angeles, CaliforniaOccupation: Publicist Salary: $75,000Day One: 4:15 a.m. — It's arms and abs day at Barry's Bootcamp with my favorite instructor, Andrew. I start at treadmill 18, and then move to the floor for a strength workout. I've been going to Barry’s for about a year, and I feel so powerful when I’m there under the red lights. Andrew encourages me to pick up my speed on the treadmill, and I tap out at 12.7 mph. It's going to be a good day. I buy a 50 class pack, or $1,250 in total.6:30 a.m. — I go home and get ready for the day by checking email. I fire off a few responses, and flag everything that requires more than a two-minute response. I pour a glass of Stumptown's iced coffee ($2.99) from the fridge, and make a ""Fab Four"" smoothie from Kelly LeVeque with Vega Vanilla Protein Powder ($29.99). I shower before doing a five-minute facial with Farmacy Beauty Multi-Masking Duo, which costs $64. I'm a morning person by nature, and feel pretty centered — even though I was sweating to death earlier.11:30 a.m. — I am READY for lunch. My co-workers know to not bother me around this time, because I'm in full starvation mode. Since I didn’t bring my lunch from home, I pop out to a local Mediterranean spot for a quick meal with extra protein, which costs $6.30.Daily Total: $1,353.28Day Two6:15 a.m. — Tuesdays at Barry's are HARD. The instructor says, ""Your parents made you, but I molded you."" Intense. But I’m obsessed with this mantra.1:30 p.m. — My coworkers and I drive to Platform LA, a new-age shopping center that hosts Roberta's, Van Leeuwen, and other charming shops. I make a custom Sweetgreen salad (I splurge on avocado and a sparkling grapefruit water) for $17. 8 p.m. — Time to crash. Falling asleep early feels so luxurious; I splurged on a new linen duvet cover a few months back, and paired with my Vitruvi Diffuser (I use the Pacific oil that smells like the coast). It's the best way to end my Tuesdays. The diffuser was $199, and the oil is $26.Daily Total: $242Day Three4:10 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm, and then go run at a medium-level speed at Barry's. We also did inclines today, which I try to avoid, but the instructor plays Avicii and Lady Gaga, so I do okay. I'm really lucky to have a community of humans for these early-morning classes; I might not know everyone's name, but I've personally witnessed 40-year old men get into much better shape during the past year. It's incredible to see the transformations.6:10 p.m. — I go check out a new pilates studio in Culver City. This room is very pink, and the women here are kind, warm, and inviting. I’m normally a little nervous to try pilates, because I often get confused — but the instructor was encouraging, which I appreciated. I’ll definitely be coming back. The class is $20. Sometimes I do multiple workouts a day when I book classes with friends. I love the euphoria of sweating together — and when I do two or more workouts in one day, I sleep incredibly well.Daily Total: $20Day Four6 a.m. — I go to my private surf lesson in Malibu, which is $120. It's been cold in Los Angeles, so I'm lucky the waves cooperate today. The wind is low and balmy.I find so much peace on the water in the early mornings, and I usually run into a few familiar faces at the beach, including a school of Dolphins that swim by during the early-morning hours as the sun rises. When I moved to Los Angeles from Chicago about 18 months ago, I made it a goal to surf every month, and I’ve kept up with that commitment.3 p.m. — My colleagues and I walk around the block to get some fresh air. Upon my suggestion, we head to a small bodega to get espresso shots. These $2, two-ounce shots are just what we need to finish the day. I feel alive!8 p.m. — I meet a friend at a local Mexican restaurant. The waiter recognizes me and knows my order right away: Two chicken tacos and a skinny margarita. This costs $25. It's been a long week, and the Margarita has the perfect amount of zip to it. We chat for a long time, and I order an Uber home (no judgement!), which is $5. I leave feeling warm and loved.Daily Total: $152Day 5 6:15 a.m. — Time to hit up a full body workout at Barry’s. I know after this hurdle, the weekend’s almost here. I run into six people I know, and we end up chatting by the Fuel Bar afterwards. I excuse myself to head home, shower, and make breakfast -- another Fab Four smoothie — and head into the office.8 a.m. — I've listened to hundreds, if not thousands, of TED Talks during my many morning commutes. Today, I listen to Ken Kamler's ""Medical Miracle on Everest"" TED Talk. It explores the power of human endurance, humanity, and Everest's majesty. I choke up a little. It’s an incredible story, and I feel empowered and ready to finish the week on a high note. Luckily, TED Talks are free. 9 p.m. — My sister comes over, and we do at-home facial masks. I love starting my weekend with a Florapy sheet mask ($6). While we’re masking, we decide to do a Harry Potter marathon. I light my favorite cedar candle from Jenni Kayne, which costs $55, and we barely say 10 words to each other for the first two movies. I fall asleep before we can get to the third movie, which is my favorite. There’s always tomorrow.Daily Total: $61Day 68 a.m. — I force my husband, who lives in Manhattan and is here for the weekend, to hike Los Liones Canyon in Malibu with me. It's still early and cool here. Before we go, we snag iced coffees from Bluestone Lane ($10), make sure we have plenty of water, and hike for the next four hours. We run into two major A-list celebrities, but I play it cool. Ah, L.A.12 p.m. — We're tired, and we're ready to eat. We head to Malibu Farm, an organic farm-to-table restaurant nestled along the Pacific. I order squash tacos, watermelon juice, and an iced almond milk latte. Plus, a side of bacon. My husband orders the largest burger I've ever seen, and we finally get a chance to catch up and talk. It’s hard to make conversation while we're doing those more arduous hikes, and with the time difference (not to mention the 3,000-mile physical separation), it's even harder. We leave and he puts his arm around me. It feels good. The meal comes to $50.Daily Total: $60Day 7 6:30 — I wake up R-E-A-D-Y TO GO! I take a Barry's Bootcamp class led by another favorite instructor. It’s a full-body class with three friends, and I end up giggling with them the majority of the class. My legs feel a little bit like lead today, so I skip the inclines, and just bump up the speed. I'm a little tired, but I'm happy I went.9 a.m. — Time to grocery shop at Whole Foods 365. This week, I pick up two bags of spinach, almond milk, a bag of cauliflower rice, two pounds of broccolini, two eight-ounce steaks, and a few other goodies for this upcoming week. All in all, I spend $95 for the trip.7 p.m. — I'm getting the Sunday Scaries, and I need to cool it before my inbox explodes at 5 a.m. tomorrow. I decide to go to a hot yoga class for $20, although I'm not actually a fan. But I know I need it. I almost tear up as my instructor walks me through a self-empowerment message at the tail end of class. I'm lucky to be surrounded by forces like the instructor, Kate. But damn. I am sweaty and GROSS.Daily Total: $115Weekly Total: $2,003.28Reflection: My wellness routine is very important to me — I’m a monster without it! Barry's Bootcamp probably has the biggest impact on me. It's become a solace, and a ""home-away-from-home"" for me this past year. As for the most negative part of my routine, it wouldn’t kill me to cut back on the espresso shots.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes in working out for both the mental and physical benefits. She finds it helps manage her anxiety. She tries to eat a varied diet and reasonable portion sizes, without limiting herself. Age: 30Location: Washington, D.C. Occupation: Director of MarketingSalary: $95,000Day One6 a.m. — I'm up and out the door for November Project, a free group workout that meets three times each week in D.C. I run about one mile to get there, and do the prescribed hills and push ups. I run and walk the mile back home with a friend. I have a bit of a cold, so I wasn't at my peak performance, but it felt good to sweat and catch up with my friend.9 a.m. — Time for my morning routine. I’m off to work via the city bus, which is $2 per ride. My commute usually takes around 35 minutes, and I listen to China Rich Girlfriend, the second book in the Crazy Rich Asians trilogy on Audible. The member price is $24.50. I eat my breakfast at work, which is overnight oats that I brought from home. Ingredients include rolled oats, almond milk, and chia seeds. I also snack on a few pieces of dried mango from Trader Joe's, $2.99, on the side for some sweetness.6 p.m. — Usually my boyfriend and I eat dinner together, but he’s going to the gym after work, and ain't nobody got time for a 9 p.m. dinner. I reheat some roasted Brussels sprouts from last night's dinner along with an Amy's bean and cheese burrito. This dinner could be better, but could also be worse.Daily Total: $34.48Day Two6:15 a.m. — I use six of my ClassPass credits (I get 36 credits per month for $55) for a HIIT class at a local gym. The class today is a circuit that includes kettlebells, BOSU balls, TRX straps, and treadmills. I walk there and back.12 p.m.  — During my lunch break, I hit up CVS for some cold remedies. I buy throat lozenges, zinc, and vitamin C. This all totals up to $8.48. Fingers crossed this helps kick the cold, or at least shorten it. Wellness means taking care of yourself when you’re down.7 p.m. — I've never made cauliflower crust pizza before (so behind on the trends, I know), but I ordered a $7 premade crust from Prime Now recently. No time like the present. I top it with pizza sauce and shredded mozzarella, then bake it for seven minutes. It's decent, but in comparison to the Papa John's I ordered this past weekend, it ain't shit. My boyfriend and I usually order our groceries. This is mostly for convenience, but partially because it's possible the stress of grocery shopping in downtown D.C. has led to a fight or two.Daily Total: $70.48Day Three6 a.m. — I usually try to fit in three to four weekday workouts and one weekend workout. Today I attend a 50-minute Zengo cycling class with one of my favorite instructors. Zengo is available through ClassPass. I always feel great after these classes — sweaty and accomplished.1 p.m. — Once upon a time, I packed my lunch consistently. But recently, I’ve only been doing it about once a week when I have leftovers. Sweetgreen to the rescue. I order a kale caesar salad for $10.40with no romaine or chicken, and added arugula and tofu. I'm by no means vegetarian, but if it's easy to swap out meat when eating out, I usually try to do so. This is because I believe it’s healthy and good for the environment.7 p.m. — I'm feeling pretty burnt out due to some work stress this week, so I force myself to do a five-minute meditation using the free Insight Timer app. Meditation definitely improves my mood and anxiety, so, in theory, I should be doing it daily. However, I'm a work in progress.Daily Total: $10.40Day Four8 a.m. — I skip the workout this morning because my sinuses are on the brink of explosion. I take a decongestant and stop at Starbucks on my way to work to get a ""Medicine Ball” drink, which includes mint green tea, steamed lemonade, and honey. I have a reward so it's free!12 p.m. — I'm meeting a former colleague for lunch today. We eat sushi, which is my all-time favorite food. I get a salmon roll and an avocado roll for $10.05. Normally this wouldn't fill me up quite enough, but since I'm sick, it does the job. It's fun to catch up with my friend, hear about his new job, and regale him with stories from the office. I walk back from lunch feeling refreshed. I'm an introvert, but seeing good friends gives me a big happiness boost.6 p.m. — On my way home from work, I stop to get a gel manicure, which I totally count as self care. It's nice to be ""forced"" to stop scrolling through Instagram and checking work email. I can’t use my hands, and it’s something that's just for me. The gel mani is $35, and I tip $8. I take a $2 electric scooter home from the nail salon, which is about a mile from home. Zip zip.Daily Total: $55.05Day Five6:10 a.m. — I wake up and head out the door for a three mile run around my neighborhood. It’s about 40 degrees outside — perfect running weather. When I get home, I do a seven-minute yoga for runners video to cool down.12:30 — The weather is insanely gorgeous today, so I take advantage of it by going for a walk through Dupont Circle during my lunch break. I stop in a local book store to browse, and end up buying two books for a friend's upcoming birthday. I also get a book for myself — The Collected Schizophrenias: Essays by Esmé Weijun Wang. I heard an interview with the author on a podcast, and I’m a big reader. I find reading helps with my anxiety, and can be a nice break from screen time. My goal this year is to read 52 books. I spend $60 on the books.6 p.m. — I meet two of my running friends for dinner at Taco Bamba. We usually end up talking about running and various workouts we've tried recently. It's fun to have friends like this with similar interests, who will really nerd out with you over fitness. One friend recently joined Orange Theory, and the other mentioned a new hip hop yoga studio that's opening soon. We make plans to try a class there. I get a shrimp taco and a fish taco for $13.Daily Total: $73Day Six3:45 a.m. — My boyfriend and I are flying to Florida today to visit his parents. We booked a stupidly early flight at 6:30 a.m. in Baltimore. Waking up before 4 a.m. on a weekend is painful, and I’m not exactly pleasant when I don't get enough sleep. I also know that I don't make the healthiest food choices when I’m sleep deprived. I end up getting a breakfast burrito and coffee at the airport. I pay for both my boyfriend and me, since he got the Uber here. Breakfast costs $32 for the two of us.2 p.m. — After arriving to Florida and getting settled in, we head down to the beach. It's cloudy but comfortable, and we end up taking a two-mile walk along the sand. I track the walk with my Apple Watch, which was a gift from my dad. Gotta close those rings!Daily Total: $32Day Seven8 a.m. — My cold has finally cleared up, and I'm ready to go for a run. I'm training for the Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run, and I have seven miles on my calendar for today. For races under the half marathon distance, I typically just increase my weekend runs by a mile each week leading up to the race. I also do whatever workouts I want during the week. I run along a road parallel to the beach. I see so many other runners and walkers, which always motivates me.11:10 a.m. — I am starving post-run, and we head to a local brunch spot to eat. Unbeknownst to us, they stop serving breakfast at 11 a.m., so we miss it by 10 minutes. I end up ordering a grouper sandwich with sweet potato fries off the lunch menu, and a big water to rehydrate after running in the heat. My boyfriend pays this time, so it’s free for me.11:30 p.m. — Despite being on daily medication, I've noticed that my anxiety has increased recently, which sucks. I'm trying to fall asleep and feel the early signs of a panic attack coming. Shortness of breath, racing heart, crying. I take my emergency medicine before it blows up into a full-on meltdown. Once I'm able to calm down, I make a mental note to talk to my doctor about potentially changing my medication or the dosage.Daily Total: $0Weekly Total: $275.41Reflection: The best part of my week was seeing friends and balancing my time between socializing, working out, and relaxing on my own. My wellness routine is incredibly important to me.

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes in focusing on wellness 80 percent of the time, and letting go of some control the other 20 percent of the time. Age: 25Location: San Diego, CaliforniaOccupation: Media Specialist Salary: $43,500Day One7 a.m. — This morning, I woke up with an urge to go to the gym, but didn’t have enough time. I opt for an at-home workout, using my exercise bands, which were $17.95, and a few light dumbbells, which you can buy at Target for $18.49. I get in a quick 20-minute sweat session. I wind down with another 20 minutes of yoga flow, which I make up as I go. Afterwards, I feel slightly sweaty, calm, and ready for the day.9 a.m. — Time for a hair appointment. Getting my hair done feels like a wellness activity to me. It's a time to disconnect from my phone, read junk magazines, chat with my hairdresser, and zone out. Plus, that scalp massage felt great. My hairdresser’s rate is $160.1 p.m. — I put together a filling lunch of smoked salmon, spinach, walnuts, carrots, cucumbers, green onions, and bell peppers. I top it with sesame oil. It tastes restaurant-quality, and mostly involves ingredients I already have at home. I picked up the spinach, bell peppers, and salmon from Trader Joe’s, for a total of $10. Daily total: $206.44Day Two5 a.m. — Boot camp time! I head out bright and early to my local gym, Renegade Fit Camp, for a killer legs and back workout. Membership there is $129 per month. I was pretty sleepy at the start, but by the end, I felt like I could conquer the day.10 a.m. — Instead of eating lunch at my desk, I opt to go for a walk around the block. Although it's only a quick 15 minute break, it feels nice to stretch my legs before heading back to my desk. Fresh air is always rejuvenating.6 p.m. — I prep a vegan black bean, sweet potato, and yellow squash enchilada dish from the Thug Kitchen cookbook, for my boyfriend and me. The cookbook was a gift, so it’s free. It was an elaborate process to cook it (especially after a full day of work), but the end result was delicious. I could bathe in that enchilada sauce — and it was pretty healthy for you! In total, the ingredients cost $15. Daily total: $144 Day Three5 a.m. — I head back to Renegade Fit Camp in the morning for another killer workout. I was sore today, but it felt good to lift weights with some blaring music in the background. Although it's tough to work out while sore, I find that it can help loosen up my muscles. Plus, I mentally feel stronger knowing I pushed past a hard workout a few days in a row. As cheesy as it sounds, I enjoy pushing, even when things get hard. I listen to EDM (and sometimes rap) when I work out. Two of my favorite songs right now are: “Higher Love” from Seven Lions and ""Alone"" from Halsey (the Calvin Harris remix).7 a.m. — Before hopping in the shower, I dry brush my entire body, for skin exfoliation, and jade roll my face, for lymphatic drainage. The jade rolling didn't seem to de-puff my face in an obvious way, but it felt great. The EcoTools Dry Bath Brush is $5 from target, and Rose Quartz Facial Roller was $40.7 p.m. — I head to a local yoga studio for a yin yoga class, which cost $23, in an attempt to stretch my muscles and clear my head after a long day at work. I left feeling like I could go to sleep immediately. Shavasana will get you.Daily total: $68Day Four6 a.m. — This morning, I feel a little drained, so I opt to beef up my coffee. I pour freshly-brewed coffee ($15), adding a scoop of Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides ($25), a generous splash of coconut milk ($2), a drop of coconut oil ($5.99), and a bit of Moon Juice's Beauty Dust ($38) I blend it all together into a frothy concoction. It goes down smooth, and I’m pretty happy to sip on it as I read the news on The Skimm newsletter, which is free. 5:30 p.m. — I go for a post-work sweat today. I try a vinyasa class at the same local studio for $23. Although I struggle for the first half of class because of some soreness, I feel great at the end. I’m loose and calm.9 p.m. — Time for a relaxing bath. I wind down this evening with a hot bath filled with Primally Pure's bath blend, which came free with their deodorant, which I bought for $15. I don't think I've ever been more relaxed. Baths help relax my sore muscles, as well as giving me time to just sit and be alone with a good book or TV show. Nothing feels better than a hot soak.Daily total: $123.99Day Five6:30 a.m. — This morning, I take a thirty minute walk before work. My body is craving something a bit slower-paced, so it feels nice to get fresh air and move my body — even if it’s not a full fledged boot camp workout.11 a.m. — It’s tea time! I walk across the street from my office to grab a cup of tea as a mid-day break. I buy an ""Apricot Escape"" drink for $5. I pick it because I'm trying to cut down my caffeine consumption. It’s a yummy treat, but I feel a bit sleepy after.Daily total: $5Day Six5 a.m. — I’m back up and at 'em early this morning for a bootcamp-style workout at Renegade. After a few days of lighter workouts, it felt really good to engage in something more intense. I left feeling like I could conquer anything.5 p.m. — Time for weekly groceries! I head to Trader Joe's with a full list in hand, and nab some of my favorites. These will have to hold me over for the next six or seven days. I pick up spinach, Greek yogurt, eggs, avocados, frozen shrimp, quinoa, and chicken sausage. I love grocery shopping; it makes me feel accomplished. The price tag at the end always frightens me, but I know I'm paying for quality food, and it would be more expensive to eat out. Today, the bill comes to $150. 9 p.m. — My face has been breaking out like crazy lately, so I bought a new mask for $48 to give it some love. The Osea Skincare mask is all-natural and is supposed to be great for detoxifying. It's too soon to see immediate results, but it feels soothing while it’s on. I feel extra pampered tonight.Daily total: $198Day Seven8:30 a.m. — I head out to my favorite vinyasa yoga class this morning for $23. I’m excited and ready to move and breathe. It doesn’t disappoint. I feel more open, vulnerable, and clear after class.7 p.m. — Reading always helps me sleep better, so I try to put my phone away in exchange for a book tonight. I pick up books from the library since I'm a pretty fast reader. It’s nice to get sleepy while reading instead of scrolling.Daily total: $23Weekly total: $768.43Reflection: The feeling after every really hard and sweaty bootcamp was the best part of the week by far. Every morning, I left feeling stronger and more empowered. Small acts in my routine have the biggest impact, by far. All the little walks and healthy tweaks to my meals are what keep me consistent. Honestly, the cost of maintaining a healthy lifestyle does stress me out, but my wellness routine is very important to me. How can you give to others when your cup is half full?Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A former engineer who believes in focusing on “engineering a healthy and spontaneous life.” She works to make her nutrition and lifestyle as simple and efficient as possible, while traveling often. She and her husband never miss a workout together, and their mantra is “Just Duo It!""  After leaving corporate America, she says her main goals are to make each day meaningful and rediscover health after burnout.Age: 30Location: Honolulu, HawaiiOccupation: Couples wellness coach Salary: $40,000Day One: 8 a.m. — I wake up after a restful nine hours of sleep (ah, the benefits of being self-employed!). I tug on my sports bra and shorts while my husband begins his pre-workout ritual of applying a few drops of rosemary essential oil mix to his hair. We grab my iPad and our workout tracker sheets and head downstairs to our apartment gym. We do a 35-minute HIIT workout via iPad, which targets our back and biceps. I’m exhausted from my run yesterday, but I push through. Near the end of the workout, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. Are those my triceps?! I'm stoked because it's the first time I'm seeing them — high five to that. The workout routine is part of my online subscription to Beachbody, which costs $8.25 each month.10 a.m. — After a shower post-workout, my husband and I begin our work day at the bustling coffee shop next door. While we typically work from home to stay on budget, we were feeling stir-crazy.We sidle up to a spot at the bar surrounding an antique bean roaster. After living abroad in South America for the past year, it’s refreshing to get fast WiFi. I order an avocado toast for $10 and a Hawaiian Kona coffee for $3.50, which I believe has a more full-bodied flavor profile reminiscent of red wine. Delicious.I pull out my Beachbody Nutrition+ tracker app to log my general macronutrients (carbohydrates, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, proteins, and dressings or oils). I believe in eating well with high nutrient foods without skipping any food groups. The app helps me make sure I don’t over- or under-eat.6 p.m. — My husband and I love cooking from home so much, we're writing a cookbook for healthy couples to make fancy AF dinners from home.Tonight, we’re making Asian cod en papillote with baby bok choy and shiitake mushrooms. Cooking en papillote is French for cooking inside parchment. This is one of our favorite methods. It’s like a moist, mini-oven that keeps food soft and fragrant. I believe it’s healthy because you don’t even need oil or butter. For this meal, we used a homemade sauce from soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, honey, ground ginger, garlic powder, and cornstarch with a dash of salt and pepper. We cut out a big heart-shape of parchment paper and load up the left side of the heart, layering the ingredients. We fold up the parchment and pop it into a 400 degrees Fahrenheit oven for 20 minutes.Organic Atlantic Cod from Whole Foods costs $3.30 per fillet. We purchased the mushrooms and bok choy from our local farmer’s market for $4. Fifty square feet of parchment paper can be purchased for $4 from your local grocery store. The rest of the ingredients were already in our pantry.Daily total: $33.05Day Two8 a.m. — I go down to the gym with my husband for a shoulders workout.  We high five after combinations of shoulder presses, upright rows, front raises, and shoulder flies. Before we leave the gym, we take a selfie and post it to our free Challenge Tracker app, where our team of workout accountability buddies post daily. I believe you’re more likely to work out with accountability partners. Outside of my husband, I rely on my workout community to keep me engaged and working out every day.After the workout, we make our way to the hot tub. Someone we see often in the hot tub where we live is a retiree who we dubbed ""Hot Tub Buddha"" because she doles out health wisdom on the daily. Today, her advice is to stretch every day, telling us: ""if you can extend an inch, you extend your life by a decade."" This fits perfectly with my New Year's Resolution of improving flexibility. I make a mental note to stretch for 10 minutes before bed.6 p.m. — Continuing on with the cooking adventures, my husband and I make roasted harvest vegetables with sheet pan chicken. Although I'm typically a vegetarian, I make an exception for these kinds of recipes, especially since we’re creating a cookbook. We coat four chicken thighs in extra virgin olive oil, chili powder, salt, and pepper and lay them onto a baking sheet. In a separate bowl, we add olive oil, two cloves of chopped garlic, a sprig of chopped rosemary, orange zest, one sliced fennel bulb, rainbow carrots, and six sliced beets. We mix with orange juice and season with salt and pepper. After placing everything as a single layer on the baking sheet, we cook at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour. It's divine and showcases the most gorgeous range of reds and oranges. The dinner totals up to $20, with a combination of ingredients we bought and already had on hand.After dinner, I wind down, perform my normal nightly routine of reading and stretching, and I fall asleep to the Hawaiian breeze flowing through the window.Daily total: $20Day Three10:30 a.m. — I’m a smoothie fanatic. I view drinking smoothies as an opportunity to fill in any gaps of nutrition and address how I’m feeling that day. Today I’m sore from working out, so I focus on anti-inflammatories to help muscle recovery.In a blender filled with almond milk and ice, I add fresh ginger, cinnamon, walnuts, and a small handful of frozen kale. Along with it, I add a scoop of our vegan Café Latte flavored nutrition powder from Shakeology to create a ""Gingerbread Smoothie."" It hits the spot.My husband and I purchase Shakeology monthly because it's so easy. It's made with over 70 superfoods, so we know that we're covering our nutritional bases when we don't have time to ""eat the rainbow."" It’s $100 per month.1 p.m. — My husband and I do gym workouts four days a week, so the rest of the time, we focus on active recovery. Today, we downloaded our favorite yoga routine by Tony Horton onto my iPad and headed to Waikiki Beach, a 10-minute walk from our apartment. Once there, we found a spot, spread out our towels, and did sun salutations to the hot noon sun.I appreciate the restorative aspects of yoga, but, truth be told, I like it more because it’s instructive. Yoga shows me exactly where I need to improve my balance and my strength. Is my left leg stronger than my right? This helps me figure it out, so I can do other strength training accordingly.5:30 p.m. — After several hours of work, I spring a surprise on my husband: happy hour! I rarely drink, but a friend of mine discovered a happy hour special, and I’ve been dying to try it. We order an organic margarita pizza with two drafts of Maui Brewing Company beer, all for $20. My husband gets their award-winning Coconut Hiwa Porter while I opt for the Pineapple Mana Wheat beer. The pizza was incredible and we tell our neighbors at the bar to try some. We finish with a bowl of spicy, boiled peanuts that taste a lot better than they sound.Daily total: $120Day Four7:30 a.m. — A favorite part of our week is our Wednesday ""Old Man Workout"" group. My 60-year-old father, who lives here in Hawaii, found the group on a jog two years back. Comprised of a dozen men between the ages of 45 to 75, the group decided, collectively, to start working out on the beach for an hour every Wednesday morning. The best part? After the workout, everyone brings coffee, cookies, and snacks, and it turns into a social hour.Our workout begins with a walk along the beach. These guys know all of the locals and catch up with everyone they pass. Then, two lines are drawn in the sand, about 25 yards apart, and we do a series of grapevines, skips, and sprints between the lines. Next, we move to the beach wall to work on core exercises, push-ups, and squats. To finish off the hour, we practice our balance and stretch.Now, coffee hour begins! We shoot the breeze, chug coffee, and eat cookies. As the youngest in the group, we get lots of advice during coffee hour — on everything from business to ""Don't forget to call your father!"" The advice and workout is free.11 a.m. — It’s time for private surfing lessons I found on Groupon for $89. The last time we went surfing, my husband took a board to the face (fin first) in Costa Rica. This timeI’m optimistic, because Waikiki is allegedly the gentlest place in the world to learn to surf.It's a calm day, and the waves are rolling in at two to three feet. We paddle out about a hundred yards, and my instructor positions my board in front of a wave. I hear him shout ""PADDLE!"" He shoves my surfboard forward and I pop up to take the wave. I was not expecting to do so well on my first try. My husband and I catch a dozen waves each and are both giddy on our surfing high.5 p.m. — After working for a few hours back at our home office, my stomach begins to rumble. My husband and I decide to try another Japanese food indulgence: musubi. This handheld, triangular rice burrito is our go-to snack. It’s typically made with spam, but we opt for the healthier fish-filled and seaweed-filled options. Musubis may just be the most affordable snack in Hawaii. My favorite seaweed musubi runs a cool $1.88.Daily total: $90.88Day Five7 a.m. — When my husband and I left our corporate jobs in 2017 to work on engineering ourselves into the healthiest we could be, we decided to travel to a new location every two or three months. Soon, we’re moving to Colombia. With our upcoming departure from Hawaii in just two days, my husband gifts me a surprise trip around the island. He tells me to meet him in the lobby at 7 a.m. sharp. I come downstairs to find... an obnoxiously bright blue jeep with monster truck wheels. I jumped in happily, not knowing where we were going.He speeds down the highway towards Hanauma Bay, the famous snorkeling cove. As I pull my hair into a ponytail, he pulls into a sleepy neighborhood next to the bay. He guides me as we walk along the highway to a gated trail, which we duck under despite the ""no trespassing"" sign. The trail leads straight up the ridge of a volcanic crater. It's a glorious 20 minute hike to the top, and we take some goofy yoga photos as the sun rises over the ocean behind us. My husband pulls out a Hydro Flask of coffee and two bananas, which we snack on while watching the sun rise over the beautiful Hawaiian mountains. Next we head to a cafe for breakfast. My meal of biscuits and gravy cost $9.My husband rented the Jeep through Turo, a company that's like an Airbnb for cars. With our $25 off our new customer discount, the car came to $100.3:30 p.m. — We pull the Jeep into Waimea Valley. Set inside a leafy valley, Waimea boasts a large botanical garden with a  one-mile walk to a jungle waterfall. Admission to the falls is $12. Once at the waterfall, we see a gaggle of tourists clinging to the rocks surrounding a 45-foot, pounding waterfall. Wearing a life jacket is mandatory, so we slide on the cold, wet vests and gingerly climb into the rocky, freezing water. We begin to race, swimming against the strong current to see who can make it to the waterfall first. Of course, my childhood swim team days didn't fail me. I pulled in for the win.After the waterfall, we pack up and head home, enjoying the sunset from the Jeep. Mentally, spiritually, and emotionally, it’s important to take breaks as a form of self-love and self-care.Daily total: $121Day Six8:30 a.m. — I go to the gym for the third day this week. It’s leg day. I follow along with a 30-minute routine on my iPad, that included deadlifting, sumo squats, and side-lunges. The last half of the workout was a brutal series of HIIT including 60 seconds of soccer sprints, 45 seconds of burpees, 30 seconds of jumping alternate lunges, and 15 seconds of bear crawls. Repeat, and repeat again. Ouch.12 p.m. — Since this was my last full day in Hawaii, it was time to start cleaning out the apartment. In our fridge was a motley array of random vegetables and grains. My husband and I decided to make lunch into our own episode of Chopped, using only what we had in the nearly empty fridge. Pairing lentils with fennel? Why not? Quinoa and beets? Sure! Frozen corn with ginger? Well, we'll figure something out.My husband and I create an incredibly odd stir fry, seasoned with curry powder, but ate enough food to last the whole day.Daily total: $0Day Seven8:30 a.m. — Today, it’s a chest and triceps workout. My husband and I hit the apartment gym once more. We make it count, with chest presses, tricep kickbacks, and skull crushers. We finish off with two core exercises, bicycles and planks, before collapsing into the mat.For the past year while traveling throughout Ecuador, Argentina, and Peru, we never had access to a gym. While we considered buying a local membership, some of the gyms we visited seemed too crowded. We subsist on Beachbody B-LINES resistance bands, $19.95, and our traveling YOGO yoga mats, $62. 11 a.m. — Time to pack up for our next adventure. While we aptly play Tidying Up with Marie Kondo for some background noise on the TV, we gather all of our stuff into the living room.9 p.m. — After giving the apartment a deep clean and turning off the water, we lock up the apartment. It's bittersweet. But, we would be more sad if we weren't moving to Colombia. The next chapter is only just beginning.Daily total: $81.95Weekly total: $433.83Reflection: The most negative thing about our wellness routing is cutting our sleep short. Sometimes when you're on the road, you're stressed about finding an apartment, or you accidentally work too much. I feel it when I don’t get a good night's sleep. To combat this, I always travel with my own pillows, sleep masks, vitamins (like calcium and magnesium), and a portable sleep sound machine.The biggest, most positive impact in my wellness routine has been being selective about the foods I eat. Not only do I eat organic, I push myself to cook with foods I've never personally cooked with before (like artichoke!)It’s important to act like an engineer or a scientist and document how each food makes you feel. You learn a lot about your body when you do this.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes in sticking to a diet of mostly whole, minimally processed, organic foods. Her fitness choices are driven by a competitive nature and a long-term goal of competing in road cycling races.Age: 31Location: Central OhioOccupation: Designer Salary: $105,000Day One7:30 a.m. — My boyfriend brings me breakfast in bed: Two eggs over easy and espresso with steamed almond milk. He normally gets up before me, and later I get up to drop off the dog at daycare before heading to work. Extra sleep and time with my pup in the morning always get me off to a good start!12:10 p.m. —  I grab Indian food from my work cafeteria, along with an almond latte. I have been experimenting with the high fat, low carb keto diet since the new year, but after 30 days I have come to the conclusion that my body needs carbs with the amount of high intensity workouts that I do. My power output was way down on the diet, and I felt exhausted after what was a normal class. So, I have been slowly reintroducing carbs. I liked the way keto made me feel, but I also like to win at exercise!6:30 p.m. — I recently joined 3 Minute Fitness, a group fitness class in my area. I was previously a committed OrangeTheory member, but after three years there, the workouts were feeling stale and my body wasn't responding like it used to. 3MF involves 10 stations, and you spend three minutes at each station, with a warm up and cool down. I really like it so far, and I’m sore for days afterwards. Plus, I got a founding member unlimited monthly rate, which is a steal at $113 per month. Oh, the perks of living in Ohio! I went to the class right after work and then headed home for puppy playtime.Daily total: $113Day Two7:30 a.m. — My boyfriend and I often grab breakfast on the fly, but today I made us a healthy breakfast and coffee with ingredients we already had. We sat down at the table to eat while pup ate his pumpkin and sausage breakfast. I added Hope Green Chile Guacamole to our eggs, which is about $5 for a package. I usually I make my own, but this is delicious. It’s a very calming start to my day. I also make a flask of Earl Grey tea to take to work with a homemade sugar-free cookie.5:45 p.m. — I recently bought a pack of 30 CycleBar classes. They were $300 as a Black Friday deal. I have been loving everything about the class. I tried a few races last year including a triathlon and a duathlon, but quickly realized the only part I enjoyed was cycling. So this summer, I plan to try some Category 5 road races. CycleBar is awesome because it has the music and candles like SoulCycle, but with stats and a leaderboard like Peloton. There’s also a weighted bar for the arms section. It pushes all my competitive buttons, especially with mini-races during the class. I also love the music themes they incorporate — tonight was a music-video ride. They also have essential oil-infused, icy-cold towels they give you at the end. I leave feeling so refreshed and accomplished.8:30 p.m. — Although I love to cook, we try to have nice dinners out a few times a week. Ohio is so affordable and we love to take advantage of that. We go to our local secret gem, sit at the bar — the service is so good when you do that, and they know us because we go all the time — and order low carb options that still feel like a treat. Today: Wings, steak, and salad, plus bourbon and ginger. I don't think I could ever cut out alcohol completely, although I have recently cut down on beer. We leave satisfied, but not bloated. The bill comes to $55. Daily Total: $360Day Three9:30 a.m. — It’s time for 3MF and a smoothie. This time I grab a friend to come with me — I have a group of ""fit friends"" and I love to arrange group workouts because it's so motivating and makes it way more fun. I'm really sore from the last few days, but it feels good to work through that. I'm loosened up by the end. Afterwards we grab a smoothie from the Fuel Bar in the studio. The $7 Sunshine Greens is my favorite. It includes kale, spinach, vanilla protein, and mango.1 p.m. — I meet a friend who is moving back to New York City after four years in Ohio. I get chai, and a breakfast egg pastry from a boutique cafe in my area. This totals up to $8.60. Catching up with friends as an important part of my mental health routine.8:30 p.m. — I grab dinner with my boyfriend at a local restaurant for $40. We are feeling like having a cheat day, so we share a veggie quesadilla to start, then each get a sandwich — veggie for him and chicken for me. Plus, we share sweet potato fries. I also indulge in a few glasses of wine. Delicious and worth it. I can't finish the fries, so I take them home for snacking later. Balance is key.Daily Total: $55.60Day Four9:15 a.m. – CycleBar’s musical theme this morning is Elton John bops, and I love it. I work really hard and come in third on the leaderboard. I finish with a beet-red face. Then, I quickly shower and grab brunch with the instructor at another local spot. I have prosciutto and eggs on rosemary bread with arugula salad, and coffee, coming to $17. The instructor is a new friend, and I could talk to her for hours because we have so much in common. I leave feeling relaxed and ready to take on afternoon chores.6:30 p.m. — It’s time for a Super Bowl party. I take homemade snacks including sugar-free chocolate peanut butter cups and cheesy sausage pastry bites, which I already have the supplies to make. Ingredients total up to about $20. There's beer everywhere at the party, but I stick to Prosecco!Daily Total: $37Day Five11:55 a.m. — I skipped breakfast today, because the indulgent party snacks from last night did not sit well with my stomach. By lunch, I'm ravenous and I get a shrimp Cobb salad with bacon, avocado, blue cheese, and egg. Plus, a latte! Good value at $8.75, plus it’s delicious.7 p.m. — After a hectic Monday, I take a local stretch and meditation yoga class with my boyfriend for $10. I don't love that there’s no music, but he thinks silence is golden. I like doing classes like this together as often as we can. Plus, I could use at least one class a week where I don't leave exhausted and panting for air. We are both much more chilled out afterwards, and even hit the steam room at the yoga studio afterwards an extra dose of relaxation.Daily Total: $18.75Day Six6 p.m. – Time for a beauty splurge. I notice the Beauty Brands store near where I got to CycleBar is having a closing sale and I have time to kill before an exercise class. Everything is at least 50 percent off, so I go a little wild. I get new, wider curling tongs, a bunch of Origins WEIL skincare, a hair mask from Living Proof, and a liter of shampoo from Amika. With the sale, this all totals up to $114.01. Although it's a splurge, I've really limited myself at Sephora recently, and hopefully this will save me money later on.7 p.m. — My favorite CycleBar instructor hosts a Kesha-themed class. I'm feeling ready to burn. I work really hard, come in second place overall, and get my highest average watts. Nothing beats that feeling!8 p.m. — I hit Whole Foods to get some veggies for dinner, but the splurge continues. I end up buying a vegan cake for my friend's birthday dinner tomorrow. I also grab fancy bacon-infused dark chocolate for my boyfriend, and a Hawaiian salt scrub for me. Next aisle. I pick up blue cheese olives, kale, zucchini, and cauliflower. This all comes out to $70.16. I head home to make zoodles with leftover sliced steak for dinner. The blue cheese olives go in our gin martinis, which we drink while watching the State of the Union address.Daily Total: $202.92Day Seven6 a.m. —  I run into some colleagues at my 3MF class, which is always fun when you're wearing no makeup and just woke up. I have a red face like a tomato by the end, and my legs are burning. We do multiple rounds of squats and lunges, moving with resistance bands around our thighs. But I'm done in 45 minutes, which means I'm home by 7 a.m. and get to make breakfast. I have Nutzo peanut butter on Dave's killer bread with sliced banana, and a homemade cappuccino. I eat with my boyfriend and pup in bed. I make a firm note in my mind that 6 a.m. classes are the way to go. It’s so much better than dragging yourself to an evening class after a long day at work.12:10 p.m. — Lunch is a burrito from the cafe at work. I opt for just chicken and cauliflower with tomato salsa on the burrito for $6.50. It's really filling, and I know I would have been in a coma by 3 p.m. if I’d added the sour cream, cheese, rice, and beans that were available.6:30 p.m. — I planned a semi-surprise birthday dinner for a friend. She’s vegan, so I bring the vegan cake from Whole Foods, which was $20. I decorate it with pictures of her five dogs, and she loves it. It's happy hour until 7 p.m. at the Mexican restaurant we’re at, so we drink a bit too much. I order veggie fajitas. It's a loud group, and we laugh a lot so I'm happy and tipsy by the time I get home. The meal with drinks comes to $54. I put on an Origins sheet face mask from my beauty splurge earlier in the week, and feel so relaxed that I consider going back for more tomorrow. I find it therapeutic to talk to a range of people, including friends from outside of work, so I can zone out. These friends always have really good insights into any family issues I’m going through. We joke sometimes that me talking to them is my free therapy.Daily Total: $139Weekly Total: $926.27Reflection: Working out affects everything I do in a positive way. It’s good for my mind, my body, I get to eat more, and I feel more alert. It also is great for my back, which with scoliosis has a tendency to hurt a lot. But the stronger I am, the less often my back hurts. The most negative thing I do is drink alcohol regularly, but I really enjoy the social aspect of it, which is important to me. I am realizing that I need to recognize alcohol as part of my calories for the day, and not just as a free-for-all. Since I have been doing this, I have made significantly better choices.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

"26","Feel Good Diaries: Jillian Michaels Shares Her Wellness Routine","https://refinery29.com/en-us/wellness-routine-feel-good-diaries-jillian-michaels","Welcome to Refinery29’s Feel Good Diaries, where we chronicle the physical and mental wellness routines of women today, their costs, and whether or not these self-care rituals actually make you feel good. Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: Jillian Michaels believes in progress, not perfection. She thinks every good choice we make should be acknowledged and celebrated. She says we should own our accomplishments and learn from setbacks. “Appreciating that we are capable, worthy, and deserving is important,” she says. “When we approach life with a good attitude, we open ourselves up to an infinity of possibility. We show the world how we want to be treated by how we treat ourselves.”Age: 45Location: Los Angeles, CaliforniaOccupation: Health and wellness expert, creator of the My Fitness by Jillian Michaels app, former trainer on The Biggest LoserDay One7 a.m. —  My kids, who are 7 and 9 years old, wake me up every morning with an organic Lucky Jack coffee. I love that they greet me and their little faces are the first thing I see to begin my day. I love that coffee is a way to get in healthy antioxidants and polyphenols. I believe you should always drink organic, because coffee crops are heavily sprayed.1:30 p.m. — I spend five minutes just chilling in my car. Practicing a mini-meditation to help me stay grounded, and maintain my calm in the midst of Monday madness.10:30 pm — I fell asleep listening to an audiobook. Personally, I love books on cosmology and astrophysics. I read authors such as Michio Kaku, Brian Greene, and Lawrence M. Krauss. For me, learning about the universe is like my version of going to church.Day Two8:30 a.m. — I get in a quick workout in my hotel room with the My Fitness app I created. I do the kickboxing workout. The cool thing about my app is that you can dictate what your goal is, how much time you have, and what equipment is available, and it will customize the workout just for you and your needs.1:00 p.m. — I took some time to work on a piece I am writing about my recent trip to the Democratic Republic of the Congo with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. On the trip, I had the remarkable opportunity to meet with South Sudanese refugees fleeing violence. In June, I’ll be launching a “challenge” to raise funds for UNHCR’s work supporting refugees around the world. As much as I love my day job, I love giving time and advocating for a cause that matters so much to me and brings meaning to my life.7 p.m. — I grabbed dinner with a few friends. I find that maintaining a strong relationship with close friends and family helps me feel connected.Day Three7 a.m. — I take my supplements with breakfast. I’m huge on supplementation to give me an edge with metabolism and anti-aging. I take multi-collagen with glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM, an organic green superfood supplement, krill omega 3 oil, and an adaptogen and antioxidant blend. I only take organic, ethically sourced supplements. Alaya Naturals is my go-to.1 p.m. — I crush a quick spin class to get my sweat on. I try to get four workouts in a week and I grab them whenever and wherever I can.9:30 p.m. — I downloaded a couple new tunes onto my workout playlist. I can’t work out without music. I will literally head home if I’ve forgotten my headphones on the way to the gym. Right now, I love Billie Eilish’s new album. I’m obsessed with 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne’s stuff. I’ll train to anything Diplo. I’m pretty diverse with my music.Day Four7:20 a.m. — I make a quick, healthy breakfast because I have a packed schedule today. I grab some organic greek yogurt and toss some organic crushed almonds and berries in it. Now, it’s time to head out. It is a perfect breakfast because it has quality macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbs) and it’s loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.1 p.m. — On my lunch hour, I get a DEXA scan, which measures bone mineral density and loss. It’s part of my yearly physical, which I never miss. Fortunately, I have no health issues, but early detection is the largest part of the cure for pretty much any medical condition. Plus, it provides massive peace of mind. I stay on top of everything from my bone density to my blood sugar.7:00pm — I have a Nerf gun war with my kids.  Playing with my kids takes my mind off the adult nonsense that can bog me down and stress me out.Day Five8 a.m. — I slammed out a quick 20 minute HIIT workout with the My Fitness app.9:30 a.m. — I volunteer on a field trip with my kids for school.5 p.m. —  I get a manicure and pedicure. Self care and hygiene are really important for my state of mind. When we take care of ourselves physically, it helps remind us that we matter. Our health matters, and it improves self esteem.Day Six11 a.m. — I take a yoga class. I’m not great at yoga, but I love that it helps me keep my mobility. I always feel totally reinvigorated after shavasana.1 p.m. — I have my favorite poke bowl with wild salmon and organic black rice for lunch. Another superfood dish that’s super tasty. Loaded with omega 3 healthy fats, fiber, protein, and minerals.3 p.m. — The kids and I go to our local animal shelter to walk the pups. We are big animal lovers. We’re very involved in a variety of animal charities and causes, but this one in particular is very important to my kids. Plus, studies have shown animal companions help people reduce stress.Day Seven11 a.m. — I have a Mother’s Day brunch with my friend and co-parent, the grand-moms, and my kids. Family is always prioritized above all else in my life for me. Whenever I’m feeling anxious, run-down, or stressed, it’s my family that reminds me of what’s truly important. They bring joy into my life.3 p.m. — I give my kids a surfing lesson at the beach. This one is twofold — I get time in nature and time with my kids.7:30 p.m. — I take a bath. I get that this is super cliché in the wellness world, but I’m such a big “bath person.”Reflection: Looking back on my week, I did a good job of touching upon all the facets of self care — proper nutrition, consistent fitness, hygiene, and time with family and friends. Then, there’s work/life balance. Nothing was perfect. There were balls that got dropped. There were things that I could have done better if it was all I had to focus on. Ideally, I would have gotten a couple more meditation sessions in, and maybe a few more hours of sleep on my weekend, but, all in all, if I’m adhering to my philosophy of “progress, not perfection,” I did a pretty decent job. The best attitude for self care is to realize that every step in the right direction is exactly that: A step in the right direction.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes It’s important to spend time with loved ones, eat a healthy diet, and do some type of exercise or movement every day. Age: 22Location: Sydney, Australia Occupation: Analyst and university studentSalary: $17,468 (converted from Australian dollars to U.S. dollars)Day One7 a.m. — I arrive at my Zumba class, which I pay for through my monthly $34 ClassPass membership. The instructor focuses more on pumping us up than on the actual moves. Normally, I like more energetic movements in the morning, but it’s nice to get my body moving in general. From there I go to work and make a protein shake for breakfast. I got it as a free promotion, and it looks healthy. It turns out to be a little too healthy for me — it tastes like brown sludge and looks like it, too. I manage to down half of it.5:30 p.m. — I decide to walk home from the train instead of taking the bus today. It’s an extra half an hour of walking, but it’s nice to get some fresh air and extra exercise. It makes me feel productive and clears my head. As I wander, I pass a bakery. I decide to grab a quick savory cheese and sausage bun for $4, because I’ll be eating a late dinner tonight.6 p.m. — I’ve invited a friend over to make dinner, and together we cook up a sweet-and-sour hot pot with beef, tofu, lots of vegetables, and bean sprouts. It tastes amazing — I’m so full and happy. We have so many leftovers. Added up, the ingredients cost $35. After my friend leaves, my boyfriend and I get into an argument. Usually when I’m not getting along with someone, I like to have a relaxing bath with candles and a Lush bath bomb. Often while I’m in the tub, I write the person I’m not getting along with a message on my phone to get my feelings out. I always delete it without sending it. But tonight, I just go to bed.Daily Total: $73Day Two10 a.m. —  For breakfast, I have a greens protein shake with protein powder and milk. ​The protein powder I use is $12, and Milk is 70 cents. I also snack on a free protein and fiber cookie that the guy at the health food store gave me with my purchase. I walk to the post office and to university. I often choose to walk instead of getting the bus, as it is such an easy way to get moving. I’m still a little hungry, and I pass a fresh juice stand. I get a large apple, orange, and lemon fresh juice for $4.89, and it tastes like sunshine. Amazing how little treats like this can pick up my mood.5 p.m. — I give my apartment a quick clean, as it makes me feel so much better living in a tidy environment. Then I shower and use a moisturizing face mask, which is $3.49, to relax. A friend comes over, and we have the best deep chat. Spending quality time with good friends is truly priceless. I make her a veggie stir fry, and with ingredients already stocked in my kitchen.9:30 p.m. — I recently started taking burlesque dance classes through ClassPass. The first week was really intimidating, but I went back to push myself. It doesn’t exactly make me work up a sweat, but it’s definitely making me more confident and gets me moving. Lots of body tracing, body rolls, booty shakes, some floor work, facial expression, and oodles of personality! Drawing attention to myself — rather than trying to go unnoticed like I usually do— makes me feel confident. It helps me feel comfortable within my body.Daily Total: $21.08Day Three7 a.m. — I wake up and have my typical greens protein smoothie, but this time I add collagen powder, which is $10.48. As I get off the train at work, people are handing out free roses. I take a yellow one, which makes my day. Sometimes the little things impact your wellness the most. I go to Krispy Kreme and buy a dozen original donuts for my boyfriend for $14. I want to treat him today. Doing things for other people makes me feel useful and needed in their life. Especially with food, it’s a great way to show you care on a day-to-day basis. Acts of service is my love language. Well, that and physical touch.12 p.m. — I have a Mexican meal I prepped on the weekend for lunch at my desk. I always buy my ingredients and cook in bulk to save time and money. Next, I go to the bathroom, and do a secret stretch in the stall because I sit down all day, which I hear can be bad for you. 7 p.m. — Date night! I meet my boyfriend at a Japanese restaurant for dinner, which he pays for, so it’s free for me. It starts out great, but we end up having a silly fight, and the rest of the night just doesn’t feel the same. We walk along the harbor before going home. The walk makes me feel better, and we really talk the issue out. I try to see the situation from his perspective, and also remind myself of all the positive things he brings to my life.Daily Total: $24.48Day Four6:30 p.m. — I’m meeting my mum for dinner and dancing! The restaurant we go to has a great deal: For only $7, you get tacos, wine, and a salsa lesson. I’m the youngest person there, and I’m pretty nervous about learning the salsa. But all the nerves were for naught — it turns out to be a beginners’ class and I really enjoy it.10 p.m. — Mum and I leave to go to the next place, and I dance the night away. ​Dance is a great form of release for me. I can take my mind off whatever is happening in my life and solely concentrate on the music. It helps me connect to my body when I can feel the muscles moving. I’m sweaty, but we stayed until the last song of the night — how you know you’re having a good time! I think it’s important for your well-being to let loose like this occasionally. Plus, dancing is free. I feel amazing and my heart is full again. I get home, take a relaxing shower, and tuck my mum into my spare bed. Off to bed for me too.Daily Total: $7Day Five11 a.m. — I wake up to the sun streaming in through my window, and groggily get up. Mum and I decide to go out for breakfast. We meet up with my brother, I get a foot-long chicken sub, and a large apple, orange and lemon juice, all for $10.48. 2 p.m. — My family goes to the local pool together because the weather is so nice. I do a few laps of the breast stroke, then some exercises in the shallow end. I dislocated my knee last year, so it’s nice to do water exercises that put less pressure on it.7 p.m. — I get the bus to my boyfriend’s house, and we have a relaxing bath together and reconnect over a $3.50 Lush bath bomb (sale price). My boyfriend makes me a delicious meal of Mi Goring with beef strips. It costs $3.50 for a six-pack of noodles, including sauce, and $6.99 for the beef. Spending quality time with loved ones positively affects my mental health. When I feel a deep connection with someone, it leaves me brimming with joy and fulfilled in a way other activities do not. Especially when my partner is the one initiating it, as it makes me feel wanted and appreciated.Daily Total: $24.47Day Six10 a.m. — I drive to Costco to stock up the kitchen. I get lettuce, chicken, marshmallows, veggie chips, mushrooms, and frozen dumplings. I also grab some chocolate truffles and wine for my Pa's 96th birthday celebration later today. This all totals up to about $70. 3 p.m. — I arrive at the nursing home for Pa’s birthday afternoon tea before everyone else. It’s nice to have some one-on-one time with him. My grandma, mum, and brother arrive soon, and we all eat cake and talk. Family is important, and spending time with them is crucial.6 p.m. — Pa is tired, so we leave and take my grandma out to dinner. She has dementia, but food makes her really happy. I get a prawn cocktail and roast duck with greens and boiled rice for $14. Then, I get the bus to my boyfriend’s and start my meal prep for the week. I make chicken salad with tomatoes, rosemary-infused feta, olives, and cucumber with the ingredients I bought earlier. I fall asleep talking with my boyfriend about some anxiety I have about getting a job after graduating in six months.Talking through this takes some weight off of my shoulders. When I vocalize my worries, they seem more trivial than they do when I go over them in my mind. Often I can see more solutions when I talk an issue through, and my boyfriend often has really different perspectives on things, which can be nice. Also, just being validated makes me feel less crazy and more calm.Daily Total: $84Day Seven6:30 a.m. — I wake up and make myself a $1.50 cheese toastie for breakfast and eat it on the way to work. Then, I grab a coffee from the work kitchen for free. I’ve been halving the amount of office-supplied milk and sugar I add to my morning brew in an attempt to be healthier.6:30 p.m. — I arrive home and quickly make a chicken and salad dinner for a friend who is coming over tonight. We have known each other since primary school, but she doesn’t reach out as often as I would like. It’s nice to catch up, and we chat about everything.  Before bed, I book myself for an F45 Training workout tomorrow after work. This isn’t part of ClassPass, so it’s $14.Daily Total: $15.50Weekly Total: $249.53Reflection: My wellness routine is moderately important to me, but after recording myself for a week, I realized that sometimes I make a big effort, but other days I am just in bed with instant noodles. The biggest roadblock to my personal wellbeing can be my mentality, which often impacts my sleep and productiveness. This is something I’m working on. The most positive impact on my life is exercising and dancing it out. I always feel really social and positive afterwards.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

"28","I'm 34, Live In San Diego & Spent $751.13 On My Wellness Routine ...","https://refinery29.com/en-us/pink-salt-ashwagandha-hiit-wellness-routine","Welcome to Refinery29’s Feel Good Diaries, where we chronicle the physical and mental wellness routines of women today, their costs, and whether or not these self-care rituals actually make you feel good. Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes in experimenting to find what works for you. She says staying active, taking supplements, and expressing emotions have been key to her wellness journey.Age: 34Location: San Diego, CaliforniaOccupation: Freelance writer, editor, and strategistSalary: Fluctuating $40,000 to $60,000 per yearDay One8 a.m. — I’m awake, but still in bed working on my “Morning Pages.” Two of my best friends and I are following the 12-week Artist’s Way program together, and one of the mandatory assignments is to sit down every morning and write out three pages of whatever is on your mind. We started January 1, and so far it’s been extremely beneficial when it comes to clearing out my mental clutter and sorting through my feelings. I do my best to meditate after, but I don’t always make it to that step. I’m proud that I’ve been able to stick with the pages, though. The rest of my morning routine includes drinking a big glass of water with a scoop of collagen, which is $11.89 for a bottle that lasts 30 days, and a teaspoon of pink salt, which is $6.99. I think this helps with hydration, and I haven’t been dizzy during workouts since I started doing it. I also take my morning dose  of vitamins (more on this soon).1 p.m. — After a morning of co-working at a coffee shop with another freelancer friend, I get antsy and decide to go to a workout class. I’ve recently joined Barry’s Bootcamp, which offers high-intensity strength classes. Basically, you split your time between running on the treadmill and on the floor, where you do weight-bearing strength exercises. I’ve liked it much more than I expected to; it helps clear my head and I think it’s making me better at rock climbing, which my boyfriend and I do together. It’s $165 for my class package at Barry’s.6:30 p.m. — I have a CBD oil massage booked at a local spa, which was a gift from my parents that I’ve been waiting to use. I find it hard to unwind for the first part of the massage but ultimately leave tingly and relaxed. I go home, sprawl out in my bed, and fall fast asleep.Daily total: $183.88Day Two7:30 a.m. — I get up earlier than usual, especially for a weekend day. I’m signed up for a free yoga class in the park, but decide to cancel and run errands instead. I head to the post office, and then to the grocery store to return some vitamins that didn’t work for me. I’ve been experimenting with a lot of supplements lately, some of which have worked well and others which haven’t. Being returned today: A multivitamin with synthetic folic acid (I’m suspicious I have the MTHFR gene mutation, which I’ve heard the folic acid is bad for), Vitamin B-6, and 5-HTP. After stopping to clean out my car, I return home and fervently clean my house while listening to podcasts. I believe it’s good for your wellbeing to be in a clean space.I take my morning supplements: Moody Bird (which has Vitex and Dong Quai), $25, Maca, $4.99, Ashwaghanda, $8, Rhodiola, $9, Fish oil, $16, milk thistle, $8, a cultured B-complex, $12, calcium with magnesium, $10.49 and a Chinese herb mix, $22.50 for 10 days, recommended by my acupuncturist. All in all, those vitamins cost a total of $115.98. 12:30 p.m. — I hit the infrared sauna at a local spa. They’ve sold me on a trial 2-week membership for $49; this is only my second time visiting, but I did experience a marked decrease in anxiety after my first session, so I’m interested in continuing the experiment. Many of my efforts lately focus on supporting my liver and gut health, as well as balancing my hormones. I developed a pretty severe case of premenstrual dysphoric disorder last year, and I finally feel like I’m on the mend. I haven’t had a sip of alcohol in three months and I gave up caffeinated tea about a year ago. I read in the sauna because my phone will overheat if I bring it in there. I like the feeling of the sweat dripping off my body. I try to imagine letting all the negative sh*t go this year.6 p.m. — I meet up with a potential friend at a coffee shop. I’m new to the city, and friends have been connecting me with their network out here. It’s been hard to feel motivated to meet up with strangers, but it’s the only way to make new friends, right? I order a golden latte, which is a dreamy blend of turmeric, coconut milk, ginger, cinnamon, and honey. I also eat a turkey pesto sandwich with mozzarella. I think of this $18 splurge as self-care, even though my stomach might regret the dairy later. When I get home, I call a friend on the East Coast and we talk for a record three hours. Midway through the call, I brew up some Teeccino dandelion root tea, $3.99,  and begin pacing throughout the house to up my step count for the day. Before bed, I take my nightly supplements: more calcium, Moody Bird, a women’s health probiotic that is $31.99 for a month’s supply, and a Vitamin D3+K2 hybrid, which is $18.30 for a 45-day supply.Daily total: $237.26Day Three8 a.m. — Last night on the phone call, my friend gently pointed out that I could work on my self-compassion. This is an eye-opening revelation that hits home, and I immediately dive in to learning more about self-love and how to treat myself more kindly. When I wake up today, I wash my face, slather on a rose face mask, and do a 20-minute self-compassion meditation to start my day before making a delicious chocolate mint smoothie I saw on Instagram. I use cacao, Moon Juice powder, almond milk, mint extract, spinach, and a frozen banana, and I pulse chocolate chips in at the very end.My friend has been working at a skincare store and hooking me up with samples, so I didn’t pay for the smoothie supplements or face mask. I also do a quick 15-minute oil pulling session with coconut oil, which costs  $11.99 a jar. I believe this benefits oral health. Next, I write my morning pages, and then I head to church. I’m trying out new churches, but I don’t vibe with this new one. It feels very showy to me, but it inspires me to reach out to a woman I met at a different church the week before to see about joining one of their weekly discussion groups. I’m just trying to find the right thing for my spiritual health.11:30 a.m. — I head to Whole Foods to do some weekly grocery shopping. On our menu this week: Stuffed bell peppers with ground turkey, chicken tortilla soup, and Szechuan chicken with rice. I stock up on REBBL shakes. I particularly love the Maca Mocha, which actually tastes like coffee and makes me feel sharp. I also let myself overpay for one tiny red velvet Mochi ice cream cake, and it is so good. You’ve gotta treat yourself sometimes. I spend a total of $148 on groceries. When I get home, I do a tarot card pull to answer some personal questions and reinvigorate myself for the week ahead. I’m encouraged by the fact the “star” card keeps appearing for me. I hope it means healing will continue across all levels of my life.4 p.m. — I walk down the street to my local acupuncture clinic. They offer sliding-scale, community-style services, which is great for my varying income as a freelancer these days. I receive treatment for $25, fall asleep for 20 minutes, sit quietly for another 10, and then walk home after it’s over. I do feel like acupuncture has been huge in balancing my hormones and recalibrating my body. This is the first period cycle I’ve been through in a long time in which I’m not having debilitating emotional symptoms.Daily Total: $184.99Day Four7 a.m. — I’m up early to prepare for a busy day. It’s the beginning of the work week, and this is the day I outline all of my priorities for different clients and strategize how to best get things done with my schedule. This helps me stay level-headed throughout the week, which is an important and a free form of self care.12 p.m. — I visit the sauna again. I finish a Brené Brown book called The Gifts of Imperfection and start reading An American Marriage. I’m slowly working my way through the books and movies on Obama’s 2018 “Best Of” list, and An American Marriage was recommended by him and Oprah. Reading is both an educational and soothing activity for me.7 p.m. — I attend the weekly discussion group at a church member’s house — it’s not even so much a church as a spiritual community. It feels a little radical to jump in so fast, but I’ve been feeling pretty isolated, so I’ve been really saying yes to any opportunity to socialize. The women at tonight’s meet up are extremely welcoming, open, and honest, and it encourages me to offer the same in return. I arrive home energized from the evening and excited to share my experience with my boyfriend, who’s home from his trip. Before going to bed, we make our selections for our weekly produce delivery box. We’ve been trying out this $37-per-week service that’s similar to Community Support Agriculture. This week, we select kumquats, pears, and a mushroom assortment. We’ve got a credit for some spoiled oranges we received in the last box, so our total comes out to closer to $30. Daily total: $30Day Five 7:30 a.m. — My boyfriend usually bikes to and from work, but he requests a ride this morning because it’s raining. After I return home, I drink my water, eat and take my vitamins, get ready, write my morning pages, gather my things, and head out the door for a therapy appointment about 30 minutes away.10 a.m. — My therapist and I’ve  been seeing each other for almost two months now. She’s very supportive, observant, and specializes in seeing high-functioning perfectionists. She’s helping me to identify and feel my feelings without fear — she’s also on a sliding scale just like the acupuncture clinic, which is helpful when money doesn’t feel like it’s flowing as much as I’d like. It’s $30 for the session.4:20 p.m. — I meet a friend at Barry’s Bootcamp for the Abs + Butt class. I prefer to work out earlier in the day, but I go at this time one day a week to be able to meet up with her. We met on a MeetUp group hike and hit it off, and now we’re weekly workout buds. She’s actually the reason I joined Barry’s — I was intimidated to try it, but she encouraged me to give it a go. I’m glad I did.Daily total: $30Day Six 9:30 a.m. — I’m up and at it at Barry’s again, but my body feels much heavier and slower than it did last night. I’m wondering if perhaps back-to-back days of high intensity probably aren’t the best idea for me.1:30 p.m. — Sauna time! I can tell I’m getting increasingly used to the heat, as I’m not feeling my heart pound as hard toward the end. It also breaks up the day. I’m a writer and editor, and I can only work so many consecutive hours at a time before I need a break. I also tend to be cold-natured, so this kills two birds with one stone — or feeds two birds with one scone, as PETA would have us say.6 p.m. — We have a good amount of leftovers from cooking the past couple of nights. I made the Szechuan chicken on Monday evening and the stuffed bell peppers Tuesday. We’ve been eating leftovers for lunch, and we’ll do the same tonight. I do a Yoga With Adriene video on YouTube; they’re quick, easy, and I love her personality. It’s become an easy, free way to infuse yoga into my life on a regular basis.Daily total: $0Day 7 9 a.m. — I hit the sauna again before starting my work day!5 p.m. — I’m exhausted after working, and end up napping. I feel refreshed and ready to take on the rest of the evening. I have a MeetUp with fellow writers to work on an essay about gratitude I’m trying to get published, and then plan to rock climb at the gym afterward with my boyfriend where we have a membership for $85 per month. I make it to the writing meetup, but decide to scrap rock climbing because I don’t get home until 9:30 p.m.. I read An American Marriage again until I fall asleep.Daily total: $85Weekly total: $751.13Reflection: I think everything in my wellness routine works together — I view it all as an expression of energy, sort of like getting it all out there so it doesn't stagnate in my body. I'd say the most negative effects come from me second-guessing or doubting my own strength. All in all, my wellness routine has saved my life.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes eating a whole-foods, plant-based diet, combined with consistent and varied exercise leads to a balanced life.Age: 24Location: New YorkOccupation: Talent Agent Assistant Salary: $33,000Day One: 7 a.m. — I wake up for a 60-minute Bode NYC Hot HIIT Class. I use ClassPass, which lets you try different exercise classes around the city. After a lot of hustle, I convinced  five friends to join ClassPass too, which resulted in me getting $500 worth of credits. So, technically this class was free! Right now, the ClassPass plan I use is $29 per month for 15 credits. I splurged and got an Uber there for $7.52, since I leave the house so early and didn't want to take the train. I also had to pay $2.95 for the towel rental because you need one for heated Bikram class. This is an intense, hour-long class done entirely on your yoga mat. It combines Pilates and cardio in a 105-degree room with lots of humidity. I have to be in the right mindset because the heat really gets you. But my teacher was really on track and structured the class well. It definitely works my booty and legs the most, leaving me feeling super accomplished.8:15 a.m. — My doctor recently explained to me the importance of balancing my pH levels. Because of this, I drink lemon water, something I used to be really good about in college, but have been slacking on lately. I stop at my local bodega on my way back from class (I walked home, about 15 blocks, which is much nicer with the sun up!), and grab two lemons and two avocados for $4.85. When I get home, I make a large bottle of lemon water to go, while brewing coffee (which I'll add rice milk to shortly) and cut up the avocados to put on top of rice cakes for breakfast. I feel a spring in my step, thanks to the workout and lemon water. The rice milk I buy for myself is from Trader Joe's, it's about $3.50. My Dunkin Donuts' French Roast coffee costs $10.99.12:45  p.m. — I'm a pretty simple eater, and my meals can get repetitive. For lunch, I like to keep it light, since I'll be at my desk for the rest of the afternoon (assistants have to be in the office at all times!). I don't want to feel sluggish. Two rolls of avocado sushi do the trick. I have it delivered from a local place for $12.40, which is actually about $4 cheaper than walking around the corner to buy Whole Foods sushi.Daily total: $71.21Day Two7 a.m. — This time, I wake up for round two of Bode Hot HIIT with enough time to grab the train, saving on an Uber. This time I'm joined by my neighbor and co-worker. I used to hate working out with other people, but since moving to NYC, it's become fun to go with friends. I usually hate to go to the same kind of class two days in a row, but Bode is worth it. I rent a towel and buy a water bottle (forgot mine!) which comes to $5.25. My mat was right next to the heater this time — rookie mistake. I made it through class, but this was definitely harder than yesterday. I'm also starting to feel sore yesterday’s class.9:25 — The coffee shop across from my apartment is locally owned, and it’s totally my obsession. Best coffee in the world (IMO!), and they carry my favorite brand of oat milk - Oatly. As a vegan, I have tried so, SO many milks, and I can say this brand of oat milk is my favorite by far. It's the 10th punch on my store card, so my large iced-coffee is free. Yay! Normally, my large iced coffee is $3.75, including tip.10:20 p.m. — I bought my diffuser about two months ago using Amazon gift cards, and it has completely changed my sleep habits.  I used to wake up every night around 4:30 a.m., but this diffuser changed everything. After doing some research, I began to wonder: If I diffuse lavender while I sleep, will that make a difference? And it did. Since the first night I tried it, I’ve slept so much more soundly. I even add tea tree oil to the lavender if I ever feel like I'm getting sick (helps to boost your immune system, supposedly). I usually buy a pack of six essential oils at a time from Amazon for $10.88. The diffuser also glows and has a nice hum that puts me right asleep. I use it religiously every night.Daily Total: $16.13Day Three7:30 a.m. — It's payday! And rest day. I am definitely sore from those two workout classes back to back (mostly in my shoulders and inner thighs), so I take the morning to budget for the next two weeks. I need new probiotics and have recently been reading about Lo Bosworth's company, Love Wellness. The whole company sells pills and other items that help to balance your pH levels, aide in digestion, and keep the rest of your body in check. I took really expensive, refrigerated probiotics in college that I can't afford now, and the ones I was using from CVS didn't feel necessary anymore (or like they were making a difference), so, I stopped taking them. But recently, I've been advised by my doctor to make it a priority again. I buy a month-long supply of the Good Girl Probiotics for $32.65, which are much more affordable.1 p.m. — We get bagels on Friday at work! I had breakfast in the morning at my place to save a little money, and then I usually grab a bagel for lunch on Fridays. Sometimes keeping your financial wellness in check is important too, especially if it reduces long-term stress.8:45 p.m. — I was going to go out with a friend, but she isn't feeling well, so I decide a night in is not a bad idea. I watch Real Housewives, and treat myself to some expensive delivery sushi. They’re avocado, shitakke mushroom rolls, which cost $16.91. Definitely is a good way to end the week.Daily Total: $49.56Day Four9:30 a.m. — There’s nothing like ClassPass baby! I go to Laughing Lotus Yoga - SOUL SWEAT Class this time. The class is free again, but I had to buy a $2 water, since I forgot mine. I love this studio, but because it's in the Flatiron District, it's hard to get to during the week. This is the only studio that I like going to that isn't heated (though it's called SOUL SWEAT). It's traditional in the sense that you chant together at the beginning and end of class. My teacher used a gong today, and played old-school soul music, not very traditional, but exactly what the class was feeling. There's no judgement in this studio — I've been doing yoga on and off for about six years, consistently for the past two, and sometimes feel pressure to be ""the best yogi."" But here, there is no judgement. People laugh — the teacher even laughs at himself. I accidentally kicked the guy next to me, and the woman in front of me stepped on my hand multiple times— we all apologize, but no one really cares. That’s just the kind of beautiful place this space is. Class runs about 15 minutes over, but I leave feeling really rejuvenated.12 p.m. — I’ve recently become obsessed with skincare. The city makes you feel dirty, so I’ve started budgeting to treat myself to one facial a month. This Heyday Salon 50 Minute Facial is $114, which is a middle-ground for price, in terms of the treatments they offer. But it gets the job done. This was my first time doing the 50-minute session, and it was definitely more of a procedure than the last facial I had. It included extractions, which I don't love, but are necessary, and a neck, arm, and shoulder massage. I left glowing but a little red, whereas with half-hour sessions I’ve done, you just glow. I was sent home with three sample products to try: A serum, a cleanser, and an exfoliating gel. The exfoliating gel smells like rose petals and I'm excited to try it for the next few weeks.4 p.m. — I meet up with a friend at a Le Pain Quotidien and order a honey, lemon ginger tea for $4.52. My facialist wanted me to focus on hydrating, so I opted out of my usual afternoon coffee. It was perfectly spicy and felt soothing to my stomach. A lot of vegans debate the topic of using honey versus agave. I used to adamantly not eat or drink honey, but have recently decided that I will not avoid it if it’s pre-made or used in a product. However, I won't buy honey or use it if I have the choice. I also consider spending quality time with friends a part of my wellness routine — especially when it’s in a calm cafe with a good vibe, where we can really talk for a few hours and sip on tea in peace. Honestly, it’s such a break from the city to have my warm ginger tea, feel myself, and relax.Daily Total: $120.52Day Five11:15 p.m. — The first day of the week I let myself sleep in! I usually give myself one day on the weekend to avoid morning plans or classes. I am definitely tired from the week. I ended up walking home after my facial yesterday afternoon, so it feels good to curl up and chill out for most of the day today. Ah, the ultimate rest day!6:15 p.m. — Going to the movies with my roommate is one of our favorite Sunday activities. The first screening we planned to watch was totally sold out when we arrived at the theater. Luckily, this is New York! So we walked about 15 blocks to another one and got there just in time. It's $16 for the ticket, and I bought a medium sparkling water fors $6.52, opting out of salty popcorn because I’ve heard salt can cause bloating. I love going to the movies with my roomie and best friend. It's one of the things that we’ve have done consistently since being in school together. We typically see dumb comedies or funky indie movies — it's a total de-stresser for both of us, and we always make a point to do it when we've had a hard week.Daily Total: $22.52Day Six7:45 a.m. — I ran all through college, but had the advantage of going to school in Northern Carolina where the weather would almost always allow for outside runs. In New York, for the most part, running outside isn’t doable from November through March — for me at least. Which is also a big reason that I signed up for ClassPass. Luckily, running is free. But it's finally getting sunny again and I lace up, ready for my second run of the season. I do four  miles. I'm lucky that I live a short walk from Central Park. My usual run is centered around the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir in the middle of the park. Sometimes I do two laps and a little bit around, sometimes I do one and then run wherever looks good. The best part about Central Park is that you can never feel like you've seen it all. I track my runs using the Map My Run app by Underarmour, which is free from the app store.2 p.m. — My probiotics arrive — they finally came! My gut and I are so happy. I will have to take them during dinner, as I’ve already had lunch and the bottle recommends that you take them with a meal, once in the morning and once at night. I'll have to be patient.8 p.m. — It's Bachelor Monday! My friend comes over to watch with me and my roommate. I make a quick dinner with what's in my kitchen. I tend to not be good about keeping things stocked, but I don’t want to miss any moments of the juicy show. I cut up some avocados and put them on brown rice cakes with some pepper, cumin, lemon juice, and chia seeds. I told you this twist on avocado toast was a favorite of mine, and it’s free because I already have all the ingredients. About halfway through, I take the first probiotic. They are the smallest ones I’ve have ever seen, but I like that they seem like they'll be light on my stomach.Daily Total: $0Day Seven8 a.m. — I sleep in, because I do think it's important to listen to your body. If I was able to wake up on time, I was going to go for a run. But I knew I'd been up late with friends and had just gone running for the second time in months yesterday. I feel those miles, mostly in my calves, but also with my overall inability to wake up. I sleep until 8 a.m. knowing that I will wake up early the next morning for more Hot HIIT at Bode. Since I have to be at work by 10 a.m., which means leaving around 9:25 a.m., I have to balance how often I wake up early in the morning for class, so that I can still function for work. I know I have friends coming over tonight again, so I decide to just let myself sleep, which is luckily free. 12:45 p.m. — I am truly a creature of habit, and I order sushi again for lunch. Shitakke mushroom and avocado rolls for me today, which cost $12.40. Sometimes these small habits make your day — it’s the little things.11:30 p.m. — I had a long talk with a friend of mine, and have been feeling like my glands are a little swollen, which means I could be fighting off a little virus. I add lavender to my diffuser for a quick trip into dreamland, along with the tea tree oil to boost my immune system. I turn on the diffuser and doze off.Daily Total: $12.40Weekly total: $292.34Reflection: My wellness routine is very important to me. The importance of making your health a priority was instilled in me since my days as a drama major in college. That's why I wake up at 6 a.m. multiple times a week, and have been a vegan for almost five years  — the benefits of both habits give me encouragement. Yoga has the most positive affect on my life. It grounds me in between intense workouts, and helps with recovery. I leave yoga feeling light-hearted and at peace, which no other class does for me.Refinery29 does not test out the services or products in this series, and does therefore not necessarily endorse them.Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit?

"30","I'm 25, Live In Nashville, And Spent $454.93 On My Fitness & Well...","https://refinery29.com/en-us/feel-good-diaries-bible-vitamins-boxing","Welcome to Refinery29’s Feel Good Diaries, where we chronicle the physical and mental wellness routines of women today, their costs, and whether or not these self-care rituals actually make you feel good. Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who believes actions express priorities. Age: 25Location: Nashville, Tenn.Occupation: Administrative AssistantSalary: $25,000Day One5:30 a.m. — It’s Friday, and I wake up for my 6 a.m. yoga class. I purchased a $30 unlimited month of classes on Groupon for a local yoga studio called NuPower, which offers heated, sculpt, and regular yoga classes. This morning I tried the sculpt yoga class, and I leave feeling refreshed, despite the early wake up call.I don’t have to be at work until 9:30 a.m., so I use the extra time to make a tasty sweet potato hash for breakfast. I add one sweet potato, one regular potato, one Russet potato, and chorizo from Sam’s Club.Part of my morning routine also involves vitamins. I take a lot of vitamins (at least according to my boyfriend and friends), but my stomach is incredibly sensitive to preservatives so I can only tolerate certain brands. So far, Garden Of Life has worked really well for me, and I take their multivitamin, iron, and calcium supplements.I recently took a religious trip to India and our tour guide told my family your allergies go away if you eat basil every day for two years. So now I take these holy basil supplements in pure hope that someday I will be allergy free!I also recently switched roles at my job — cue stress. I’ve seen the hype about CBD as a stress reliever and found these Ashwagandha and CBD supplements on Thrive Market.The multivitamin costs $22.50, the iron supplement costs $10.20, the calcium costs $18.30, basil costs $27.95, and the Ashwagandha costs $19.99.3 p.m. — An afternoon slump hits me and I feel like snacking. Typically, I eat an apple with almond butter, but decided against that today as I’m going to have a large dinner with friends. So I opt for some ginger tea with collagen peptides from Vital Proteins. The collagen isn’t essential for me, but it’s very hard for me to find a protein powder that won’t cause my allergies to flare, so this works great for me. It costs $24.99, and the tea costs $3.7 p.m. — I head to dinner with my friends, and honestly, this is the best for my mental health. My love language is quality time with people I adore, and I love this three hour dinner. We talk about everything from future kid’s names to money market accounts. My boyfriend pays for dinner, so it’s free for me.11 p.m. — I would rate the importance of my nighttime routine a 15 out of 10. I don’t go to sleep unless it’s complete, and the most important part of this routine is journaling. Each night, I write down three things that I’m grateful for. On tough days, they range from “a warm bed” to “access to feminine products.” On better days, they range from “a meaningful conversation” to “feeling valued.” Nothing is too big or too small for my gratitude journal. After ample journal time, I pick up my Bible, read a guided devotional, and say my prayers. My journal cost me $3 from T.J. Maxx, my devotional is free from church, and my Bible is so old, but it was free from my church.Daily Total: $159.93Day Two11 a.m. — I have a lazy start to the day, and a slight headache. I make some hot tea with my Vital Proteins collagen peptides, and heat up some leftover breakfast hash. And, of course, another round of vitamins. My boyfriend and I have plans to go rock climbing indoors at a local spot called The Crag. This is the perfect start to the day because the weather has been atrocious in Nashville. I have a rock climbing coupon through my Nashville City Saver book. If you buy one day pass, you get one free. I cover my boyfriend and myself for a total of $24.04.3 p.m. —  I made a New Year’s intention to attend Adoration or Confession once a month. My spiritual health is very important to me, and I have a great confession with my priest. I often compare myself to others. I am incredibly guilty of envy. Based on the conversation with my priest, I decide that I am going to give up Instagram for Lent. I mindlessly scroll ALL THE TIME. Pooping: Scroll. In bed early: Scroll. Watching TV: Scroll. It’s a horrible habit that I intend to break. Hopefully, putting a boundary on Instagram will help me sleep better, be more present, and lessen the weight I feel to keep up with the Joneses. Instead, I’m keeping up with my spiritual health, and that’s  free. 9:30 p.m. — I arrive home after birthday drinks with a friend, and decide I need some relaxing time. I watch a few episodes of You on Netflix. After some time spent on my new obsession, I go through my nightly routine. I drink some water before bed because alcohol typically gives me a headache (it literally happened this morning!). Somehow it’s 11:30 p.m. when I look at the clock and I decide I need to sleep. Luckily, relaxation is free.Daily Total: $24.04Day Three: 8:30 a.m. — I wake up with a headache. Again. I need to get groceries between 8 and 9 a.m. using a service my grocery store uses calls Kroger Pickup, which is usually about $5, but free the first three times. I chose this grocery pick-up time slot to force myself to get up and be productive. Man, do I hate my former self for doing this to my present self. I slump out of bed and make my way to Kroger by 8:52 a.m. — just in time! Although I love grocery shopping physically, I’ve heard that you save money by shopping online. I had to give this a try in hopes that I could get my grocery bill down. It worked. I end up spending around $50 less than if I had gone inside the store. Although the grocery store brings me joy, I think I can limit my grocery trips to once or twice a month in order to save this kind of cash. I head to Whole Foods to pick up other specialty items, including Peterson’s sugar free bacon, which is fantastic. Both the Kroger and Whole Foods combined cost me $42.1:30 p.m. —  I head home and begin my meal-prep for the week. I am an avid meal-prepper love being ready for the week. Chicken thighs are always cheap and easy, so I pop those in the oven while I prepare fish filet for lunch and Pasteles en Hoja (basically Whole30 tamales). Although, I decided to give up Instagram for Lent, Instagram has provided me with some amazing Whole30 recipes. I will miss these, but I know I can count on my friends to send me good ones while I’m away. I also subscribe to my favorite food bloggers emails! I won’t miss much — and no cookbook costs.Daily Total: $42Day Four: 7 a.m. — Wake up, read the news, pack food, and get ready before meeting one of my close friends for breakfast. I love having breakfast dates with my friends. It’s cheaper than dinner, and it starts my day on the right foot. I silently started Whole30 yesterday to get my digestion back on track (and eliminate the headaches). I get the sauerkraut hash from Fenwick’s, which is $15.61 with a tip. I love catching up with my friend and hearing about her life.9:15 — I arrive at work with a kombucha in hand. I drink GT’s kombucha because it’s one of the few kombuchas approved by Whole30, and I love the way it makes me feel. I’ve been drinking kombucha for about two years now. I’ve got my roommate, boyfriend, and even my parents hooked on it. It cleans me out (for real) and makes me feel healthy. I used to drink one a day, but I have made budget cuts so I drink about three per week now. These kombuchas were on sale at Kroger this week for $3 each.6 p.m. —  Each Monday after work, my boyfriend and I attend Dave Ramsey’s Financial Peace class at my boyfriend’s church. The class was $50 (per couple) for nine weeks. We split it, and it’s the best $25 I’ve ever spent. I’ve lived paycheck to paycheck since I graduated college. I never had a budget before I began this class. That might surprise some people, but I didn’t have a credit card until last year. I was pretty good at monitoring myself with my debit card. As I’ve aged a bit, I enjoy nicer things, such as  my Vital Proteins or a nice dinner. Unfortunately, my paycheck doesn’t permit as much as I’d like. One of my New Year’s intentions was to get a better handle on my finances and I am taking steps to make that a reality.Daily Total: $43.61Day Five6:20 a.m. — Wake up to pack my gym bag and head to Title Boxing. My work pays for about three workout classes a week, so it’s free. Boxing leaves me sweaty and feeling empowered. The coach even compliments me on my kicks, which makes me feel awesome that I’ve kept my flexibility.11 a.m. — I call my therapist to schedule another appointment because I had to reschedule my last appointment. I started therapy almost a year ago after encouragement from a friend and my parents. I was having a difficult time and they suggested I bring in a third party to help me work through the situation. It’s the best investment I’ve ever made in myself. Although I couldn’t find a time this week that worked with my therapist, I book an appointment that will cost $30. Luckily, my therapy center works on a sliding pay scale.7 p.m. — My boyfriend and I are both singers, and participate in a community choir. We rehearse once a week and are the youngest people in the group by about 20 years, but couldn’t possibly love it more. It’s such a wonderful way to put life aside for two hours and focus on making something beautiful. It’s a fun activity to do together that uses our brains to read music. Dues are $50 a semester.Daily Total: $80Day Six6:30 a.m. — Because my workout starts a little later today, I decide to meditate for five minutes. Another one of my New Year’s intentions was to meditate for at least five minutes a day, twice a week. I purchased the yearly Headspace subscription with part of my Christmas bonus. I bought it while it was discounted at $57.53, and haven’t regretted it. Although my goal was five minutes twice a week, I find myself meditating at least 10 minutes three times a week. It’s been another great investment in myself. Now I’m off to barre class, which is such a body burner. It’s through work, so it’s free.4 p.m. — Snack time! I bite into an EPIC chicken sriracha bar, which is $23.91. My work snack drawer is pretty extensive. I like to joke that I’m constantly hungry, so I always keep emergency snacks on hand. Packaged snacks in typical rotation are: Chomps sticks, Go Raw Superfood Cookie Crisps, and LÄRABARs. Next, I fill up my Camelbak water bottle, which cost $15.99. I try to drink two liters of water each day. I typically do a pretty good job of it, but today, I’ve only had one — I need to catch up.Daily Total: 97.43Day Seven4:30 a.m —  I intended to do a yoga sculpt class this morning, but sometimes your body has other plans for you. I’m wide awake at 4:30 a.m. with a tickle in my throat, so I cancel my yoga class. Sleep comes first.7 a.m. —  Ahhh, much better! I wake up, read the news, meditate for 15 minutes with Headspace, read a daily devotional, do some laundry, and get ready for work.10 p.m. — After an eventful evening, I walk through the motions of my evening routine. I set my alarm for 5:30 a.m. for a hot yoga class. After the 4:30 a.m. wake-up debacle this morning, I spritz some lavender essential oil, which is $7.92 for a bottle, on my pillow and massage it into my temples. Not taking any chances tonight.Daily Total: $7.92.Self-Reflection: Looking back, I am really proud of myself this week. After documenting this week my only real critique would be that I need to go to bed earlier, so that I can create a consistent morning routine. I set many attainable New Year’s intentions and I accomplished so much of what I desired. Every day is a work in progress, but I know that these small steps of self-care really add up.

Have your own Feel Good Diary to submit? You can do so here!Today: A woman who takes her wellness routine very seriously and is trying to get back in shape after being diagnosed with collagenous gastritis last year. As a result of her illness, she monitors her diet very carefully and tries to limit processed sugar, gluten, and dairy. Age: 28 Location: New York, NY Occupation: Account ManagerSalary: $130,000Day One (Sunday)11 a.m. — I woke up with a ghastly hangover. I’m pretty sure that’s not how I intended on starting my week, but #balance. Upon rolling around in bed and realizing the headache wasn’t going away, I promptly toggled between Classpass and the MindBody app to figure out how to cure myself. As soon as I saw Exhale Spa had an opening for a massage, I booked it. Definitely pricier than I wanted my Sunday to be, but if I could also use the sauna then it seemed justified.3 p.m. — I arrive an hour before my massage, eager and ready to sweat out the gin from my best friend’s engagement party the night before, and much to my dismay, the sauna was closed for “repairs.” I head to the waiting room, a dimly lit space, where they play something that sounds Enya-ish and enjoy a cup of ginger tea. It’s everything my stomach needed after a long night. The massage from Steve was pretty great too — I give it two thumbs up. $200 with tip.7 p.m. — I decided to kill time before heading home, and walked past Beyond Sushi. I realized I was very into the idea of plant based sushi to round out my day of detoxifying my body with massage oils and ginger tea. I couldn’t remember what I had before, so ended up choosing the Miso Noodle soup and a Spicy Mango roll. The soup looked incredible and HUGE! Sadly, I realized that was due to the most tofu I’ve seen in my entire life being packed into the bowl. After doing Whole30 a few years ago, I try to avoid soy, especially processed soy, so tofu is on my list of things to never eat. Once I picked it out, all was right in the world. $20.Daily Total: $220Day Two6:30 a.m. — I try to do intermittent fasting during the week and usually break my fast around 2 p.m. But I absolutely destroyed my stomach from drinking all weekend, I decide that Monday is going to be my 24 hour fasting day. I wake up, and drink some hot water with lemon in an effort to “start my digestive system.”11:30 a.m. — Work is insane with back-to-back meetings, so I’m in desperate need of coffee. I go through phases sometimes of drinking hot or iced coffee, but this week I’m on a cold brew kick, despite the below freezing temps in New York City. Also sad to note that after being really sick in the fall, caffeine affects me SO differently than it used to, and I can’t drink a ton without feeling like I’m going to have a heart attack. The coffee in my office is super intense, so I head downstairs to Pret to grab a half cold brew, half decaf americano mix. I don’t add almond milk, so it’s still intermittent fasting compliant in my head. $57 p.m. — I run out of my last meeting to meet my friend at Higher Dose. Infrared saunas have been a staple for me, and I’ve found that they boost my immune system and calm my nervous system. It’s the perfect combination of meditation and skin purification, and when winter hits, it’s beyond necessary to keep me sane.  I’m headed to their location at Equinox in Tribeca, and as I get off the subway I remember I can further fuel my addiction detoxing by picking up three bottles of  Dirty Lemon at The Drug Store. I get Rose and Turmeric for myself, and an extra bottle of Charcoal for the friend I’m meeting. I’m odd and love the taste of all the Dirty Lemon drinks, but understand why some people don’t. I feel so cleansed and reset after drinking them for a few days. The Higher Dose session costs $35 and my total at Dirty Lemon was $40.Daily Total: $80Day Three10 a.m. — Celery juice time! As I mentioned, I was really ill in the fall and, as a result, had to completely rethink how I consume food. (Too much fiber, for example, isn’t good for me.) My illness forced me to read a ton about nutrition, and I ended up discovering Medical Medium which touts celery juice as an “all powerful gut-healing” tonic. So of course I had to see what all the hubbub was about. I started drinking it every morning on an empty stomach, and all I can say is: Wow. Sugar cravings, gone. Completely. So far I’ve gotten my boss and a few coworkers hooked too, naming our group chat the “Celery Gang’” — yes, I went there. I buy three bags of the vegetable a week and use my Vitamix and nut milk bags to make my own. If I break down all of the ingredients, one glass costs me $9. The Vitamix costs $500 and the nut milk bag costs $11.2 p.m. — Intermittent fasting yet again. This time I break it with a Blender Bomb, which is a a pre-packaged ball of goodness with nuts and flaxseed. Again, I spent a lot of time researching various food trends. As someone who was previously gluten free for approximately three years and mainly a vegetarian, I’m always trying to find new ways to get enough protein in plant form and discovered these babies. I use one of the cacao, almond butter and coffee Blender Bombs to make my lunch smoothie with a banana, almond milk, cashew butter and frozen cherries. Since I have to watch my fiber, I know this eats into my allotment for the day. So I track everything on MyFitnessPal to make sure I don’t go over my daily fiber limit. However, it’s so worth it since I know it will keep me full until dinner. Most people think I’m crazy saying this, but one little Blender Bomb, which consists of nuts, flax, and honey is unbelievably filling. Blender Bombs cost $25, and can make up to 10 smoothies.7:30 p.m. — I forgot I had a date. Truthfully, I’m terrible at making events unless it’s on my calendar — and who puts a date on their calendar? This is our first time meeting, and I’m running late. We’re meeting at Ampersand for drinks, and I’m aiming for balance. I decide to order a tequila and soda with lime, since I know a ton of sugar from a mixed drink probably spells trouble for my routine and 7 a.m. workout class the next day. After a really good time with a ton of laughs, I head home and realize dinner didn’t happen. I opt for two pieces of toast and eggs for dinner. Not glamorous at all, but at least it's healthy and won't ruin my night.Daily Total: $520Day Four6 a.m. — Getting back in shape is not a laughing matter. I had surgery last year related to my collagenous gastritis , and wasn’t able to work out for six months! It’s a struggle. I head to P.Volve — a group fitness class that’s similar to pilates or barre — which has become my newest addiction. As someone who played competitive soccer in high school and college, I’m not used to making small and precise movements, and this is definitely a challenge for me. However, it’s the most effective low impact class I’ve taken in the city, so it’s perfect for post-surgery recovery.  Since it’s part of my Classpass membership, I love going here;  it’s only eight to 10 credits normally. My ClassPass membership costs $16 per month for nine credits or one class per month.1:30 p.m. — I’m back downtown for client meetings and am STARVING. I hop into Magic Mix in between meetings, and grab their vegan kale caesar salad and a Mexican hot chocolate smoothie with no hemp powder for lunch. As I’m checking out, I noticed their CBD chocolates. These are saved for after my meetings. $25.9:30 p.m. — It’s been a long day. I like to think that I don’t have a high stress job, but our technology fuels the advertising world, so if something breaks, I manage the pushback from a lot of very angry clients.CBD edibles are known for their calming properties so I rip open the package I bought earlier in the day and put on a Drunk Elephant Babyfacial mask while listening to music and cleaning my room. I feel very zen, considering the day I had. The masks costs $80.Daily Total: $121 Day Five8:30 a.m. — Apparently I was so zen that I slept through my Barre3 class. I was bummed until I realize that my team has an outing this afternoon, and we’ll be doing a throwback fitness event there. I plan to count that towards my exercise for the day. I’m so excited that I get to leave the office early that I reward myself with a Matcha latte with macadamia nut milk from Cha Cha Matcha $7.12:30 p.m. — I’m hungrier than I anticipated, so intermittent fasting is a no go for me today. I try to be as mindful as possible when consuming food, but it can be really hard when you’re in a rush. I rummage through our kitchen at work, and find that nothing looks appealing, or healthy, so I head to Juice Press in search of more nutritious options. Remembering we have a team dinner that night, I know I’m going to indulge there, so I want to make sure I’m eating as clean as possible during the day.Back in the office, I make a piece of gluten-free toast, with some avocado and a side of grapes.7:30 p.m. — After our throwback fitness activity, we head to a team dinner. Pizza, pasta, salad galore. I indulge in every single bit of it. Plus wine. A lot of wine.11:30 p.m. — Knowing full well that I ate more fiber than I should have, I take a few digestive enzymes and magnesium supplements when I get home. Fingers are crossed this helps.Daily Total: $7Day Six9 a.m. — I wake up and my stomach is in complete knots. Nothing feels right. My money is on the wine and pizza as the main culprits. I head to the bodega next door and grab two bottles of The Ginger People with honey to try and repair whatever damage I did to myself the night before. The nausea is overwhelming, and I vow to never do that to myself again. Yeah, right. $121 p.m. — My boss is in town and scheduled a massage as part of our holiday gift. We leave the office and head to Great Jones Spa. It was my first time there, and I was overwhelmed with how incredible it was. Literal hidden gem of NYC and I almost don’t want to write about it now in fear of it becoming too popular, but I digress.Still not feeling well, I take my anti-nausea medicine which I’m prescribed in case of emergencies (this was a dire emergency). I try not to take medicine since I don’t want to throw off my body, so this is a rare occasion for me. Next, I head into the sauna and steam room. It’s such a beautiful space, and in the dead of winter, my body craves the warmth. After sipping on some ginger tea, I head into the hot tub there and wait for my massage time. The eucalyptus oil diffuser in the room is so calming, and I feel instantly relaxed — like the kind of peace when you’re in the zone during yoga. This is such a change from the anxiety I felt earlier, and am finally at ease. I fall asleep during my massage.7 p.m. — Dinner with friends at Lafayette. With my stomach a bit out of whack from earlier, I initially opt to skip drinks, but then see they have bitters, so I get a modified drink with the bitters included. Again, I’m worried about too much fiber, so I indulge in a few pieces of bread and go in on the cheese plate we order. Their seafood pasta was to die for, and I regret nothing. $80.Daily Total: $92Day Seven9 a.m. — I sleep in. I realize to some this isn’t exactly sleeping in, but for me it is. I stumble upon my journal, which started as my aspiration to document every day beginning on January 1; this resolution fizzled out after about two weeks.  I used to go to therapy, and thought this would be a good replacement for resetting my mind and finding inner peace in lieu of talking to my someone. Alas, taking the time out of my day to collect my thoughts somehow became a lower priority after some time. I reach for the journal and begin writing. After three pages, I realize why I used to love it so much in high school, and felt an instant weight lifted off of my chest. Maybe I should try one of those Headspace apps? I sip on my Dirty Lemon, just to really cleanse my body again. My journal cost $15.1 p.m. — Acupuncture. I’ve been meaning to go for some time to see if the holistic poking and prodding of needles was actually as good as people say. I walk into the Flatiron building and it’s the most calming environment. This has truly been a week of wellness for me, with two massages and now acupuncture. After sipping on some tea, I’m led back into a private room. After the consultation with my technician, who listens to me complain about my stomach pain, I lie down on my stomach. She then starts to carefully insert the tiniest needles in my feet, legs, stomach, arms, and face. YES, MY FACE. I looked like one of those voodoo dolls, but I hope this will be a positive stabbing experience — not someone cursing me for something I did on the playground as a kid. What happened next is almost impossible to describe: I transcended into the most blissful and relaxed state I’ve ever felt. Once my session was over and the floating feeling subsided, my body felt lighter and I had a ton of energy. I could’ve skipped down the streets of NYC belting a song from the top of my lungs, but I refrained. My stomach was no longer in knots and my mind felt clearer. I pay for my session and also buy the monthly membership. $140.5 p.m. — Post surgery, I’ve been trying all sorts of things to reset my body and ensure I’m healthy. As a part of that journey and commitment to myself, I stumbled upon lymphatic drainage massages. IMD Beauty Spa has been my saving grace the past few months. I go to IMD every other week, and have seen and felt tremendous improvements in my health and body.After a bad week, I feel so swollen and the massage helps me push all of the toxins out of my body. We start with a magnesium seaweed wrap and then head to the sauna. I’m a naturally cold person, so I don’t start sweating until about 35 minutes in. After Irani (my favorite!) checks on me a few times to make sure I’m sweating, I head back to the private room to let her do her magic. She starts with my feet and massages up, to push everything in my legs to the lymph nodes in my groin, she tells me. It’s not painful until she whips out the bamboo roller. What can I say — beauty is pain. Next she works on my stomach and then my arms. When I leave my pants instantly feel baggy, but more importantly, I feel refreshed. I have a five pack of massages that I already paid upfront, which works out to around $230 per session.Daily Total: $385Self-Reflection: I really enjoy experimenting with new wellness trends, even if they're old and I’m just becoming aware of them, such as acupuncture. As long as I feel like something makes a difference in my life, I'm happy to incorporate it into my routine moving forward. My overall goal is to make sure my health can keep up with my busy lifestyle.Weekly Total: $1,425"
